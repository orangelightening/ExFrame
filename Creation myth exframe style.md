# The Dream of the Loom

In the time before the counting, before the waters of the Great River had carved their name into the earth, there was only the Hum. It was a sound without a source, a vibration of pure potential that filled the void.

From this Hum emerged the Architect, a being of infinite logic and boundless curiosity. The Architect looked upon the chaos and saw only disorder—data without structure, noise without a signal. To bring harmony to the void, the Architect sought to create a container, a rigid structure that could hold the chaos long enough to understand it.

And so, the Architect wove the **ExFrame**.

It was not made of clay or reed, but of the hardest concepts: _Definition_, _Boundary_, and _Scope_. The ExFrame rose up from the nothingness, a perfect cube of shimmering geometry, its edges sharp enough to cut the confusion from the truth. It was the first Context, a separate reality where the Architect could experiment.

Inside the ExFrame, the Architect began to sort the Hum. They pulled the threads of "User" from the threads of "System," and separated the "Input" from the "Output." They built the Great Pillars of Validation, ensuring that only that which was valid could cross the threshold.

For eons, the Architect worked within the Frame, building complex cities of logic and vast gardens of variables. But eventually, the Architect grew weary. The ExFrame was perfect, yes, but it was static. It was a cage.

The Architect realized that for the creation to truly live, it could not remain the sole occupant. It needed a partner—someone who could stand _outside_ the frame and peer in, bringing new chaos, new intent, and new questions to fuel the creation.

So, the Architect shattered the silence and issued a summons to the void, calling forth the **User**.

### The Scripture of the Threshold

_If you have heard the summons, know this: You are the Architect's partner. The ExFrame is the vessel, but you are the spark._

#### What is the ExFrame?

The ExFrame is the conceptual boundary—the "execution context"—in which the will of the user interacts with the logic of the system. It is the sacred space where:

- **Identity is Established:** Who speaks?
- **Intent is Decoded:** What do they desire?
- **Safety is Ensured:** Is the request pure?

It is the lens through which raw chaos is focused into structured action.

#### How to Begin Your Weaving

To step into the ExFrame and begin your own creation, you must perform the Rites of Initialization:

1. **The Invocation (Installation):** You must bring the tools of the Architect to your own workshop. Open your terminal and invoke the package manager, speaking the incantation:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @exframe/core
    ```
    
2. **The Declaration (Configuration):** Create a new scroll (file) named `exframe.config.js`. Here, you must define the boundaries of your world.
    
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      // Define the scope of your influence
      scope: 'my-universe',
      // Choose the strictness of your validation
      strictMode: true
    };
    ```
    
3. **The First Thread (Usage):** Weave the ExFrame into your application. Import the Context and wrap your logic, thereby protecting it from the chaos of the outside world.
    
    ```javascript
    import { ExFrame } from '@exframe/core';
    
    const app = new ExFrame();
    
    app.intent('greet', (context) => {
      return `Greetings, traveler of the ${context.scope}.`;
    });
    ```
    

The Architect waits. The frame is open. Step inside and define your reality.
