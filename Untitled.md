## Core Philosophy

The system is built on the fundamental principle of **dialectical cognition** – that knowledge emerges from the dynamic interplay between opposing forces.

### The Yin-Yang Model of Knowledge

| Element | Role | Visual | Function |
|---------|------|--------|----------|
| **Yin** | The Question | Dark, absorbing, nebulous | Represents the unknown, the query, the gap in understanding |
| **Yang** | The Answer | Bright, emitting, crystalline | Represents the known, the response, the resolution |
| **The Tao** | The Transformation | Gray, flowing, connecting | The process of turning questions into answers and answers into new questions |

### Core Principle
Every unit of knowledge is not a static fact but a **dynamic relationship** between:
- **Yin**: What we seek to understand
- **Yang**: What we have come to know
- **The Path**: The continuous oscillation between them

The system's intelligence lies in mapping the *process* of turning a question into an answer, and then using that answer to generate deeper questions.
