#### **Ingredients**

#### **Instructions**

**1. Make the Crust:**

- In a large bowl or food processor, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt.
- Add the cold, cubed butter. Using a pastry cutter, your fingertips, or pulses in the food processor, work the mixture until it resembles coarse sand.
- Add the beaten egg and vanilla extract. Mix just until the dough begins to clump together.
- Turn the dough out onto a work surface and gently knead it 2-3 times to bring it together. Press about two-thirds of the dough into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch springform or deep pie tin. Wrap the remaining dough and all dough in plastic wrap. Chill both the pie tin and the reserved dough for at least 30 minutes.

**2. Prepare the Filling & Crumble:**

- In a large bowl, toss the sliced apples with lemon juice. Add the granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Toss until the apples are evenly coated. Set aside.
- For the crumble: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use your fingers to rub it in until the mixture forms clumps of varying sizes (from pea-sized to larger crumbs). Place in the refrigerator.

**3. Assemble the Pie:**

- Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
- Remove the chilled pie crust from the refrigerator. Spread the apple filling evenly in the crust, pressing down lightly.
- Take the reserved chilled dough and break it into small pieces, scattering it loosely over part of the apples (this is a traditional step that adds texture inside the pie).
- Sprinkle the chilled crumble topping evenly over the entire surface of the apples, covering them completely.

**4. Bake:**

- Place the pie on a baking sheet (to catch any drips) and bake for 55 to 65 minutes, or until the crumble topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling around the edges.
- If the topping browns too quickly, you can loosely tent the pie with aluminum foil.

**5. Cool and Serve:**

- Transfer the pie to a wire rack and allow it to cool completely, for at least 3-4 hours. This is crucial for the filling to set properly.
- Serve at room temperature, optionally with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

### **Key Characteristics & Citations**

- **Crust vs. Topping:** Unlike American apple pie, a true Dutch _appeltaart_ often uses a buttery, shortcrust pastry (_zanddeeg_) for both the base and a lattice or full top. The crumble variant (_kruimeltaart_) replaces the top pastry with a buttery crumble, which is the style requested (King, 2023).
- **Apple Choice:** Granny Smith apples are an excellent choice for baking due to their firm texture and tart flavor, which holds up well and balances the sweetness of the crust and topping (The Spruce Eats, 2022).
- **Spicing:** Traditional Dutch apple pie is lightly spiced, with cinnamon being the dominant flavor, and does not typically include nutmeg or allspice as in some American versions (Janssen, 2020).
- **Texture:** The filling is chunky with distinct pieces of apple, and the crumble topping is designed to be sandy and crisp, not oat-based like many streusel toppings (Davidson, 2014).
