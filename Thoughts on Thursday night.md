## 1) Use docker dmr plugin 

for serving Ollama.cpp models allows gpu speed and also reduced latency of cloud connection api

 Qwen3 local model may do if treated well. Cli interface and api. This may give us some more speed. 

## 2) Use a variant of the pattern system instead of the domain log

If the patterns were created and stored automatically as part of the query/response cycle then they would in fact be the same as the log except they would be coded for semantic search and the code stored with the data. Petterns have the advantage that huimans can easily read them.

## use patterns and use them as history
generate all patterns not just by exception but for every query response. Use all the pattern search stuff to power response from the searching ai. This may allow good speed and also allow lesser llm to manage. This is all written except not tested against so many patterns.  These patterns can be curated easier than the log. To archive a) whole archive b)  just archive pattern nn to nw. To clear allow it by a) whole pattern store. B) part of the pattern store nn to nw.
We will keep the pattern editor and pattern delete to allow further spot curation.
## Back to basics. Fast local semantic searches where possible.

Dump all the log stuff and replace with sequential mandatory pattern storage Pattern storage must be sequential by date time stamp. This may be a big thing if we can use a local model

Postprocessing of the patterns for data may be easier than with a log. Question******

## Write this up and get ai to analyze this idea

  I think if we can use the sequential serialized date time stamped encoded patterns to replace the domain log. I think this mappsbetter into the fast retrieval use case. 

The patterns are very human friendly but somewhat redundant with the domain log. Unless they became the domain log. All the search code is there as well as the creation and encoding for semantic search. The system prompt is set on a domain level in config and is injected for query.
