    "solution": "If you have cut yourself, follow these standard first aid steps to manage the wound and prevent infection. **Please remember: I am an AI, not a doctor. If the injury is severe, please call emergency services (911 in the US) or go to the nearest emergency room immediately.**\n\n### 1. Ensure Safety\nStop whatever you are doing. If the cut was caused by a dirty object (like a rusty nail or glass), be careful not to injure yourself further.\n\n### 2. Control the Bleeding\n*   **Apply Pressure:** Use a clean cloth, gauze, or sterile bandage to apply firm, direct pressure to the wound.\n*   **Elevate:** If possible, raise the injured area above the level of the heart. This helps reduce blood flow to the area and slows bleeding.\n*   **Maintain Pressure:** Do not peek to check if the bleeding has stopped for at least 5\u201310 minutes. Removing pressure too soon can disrupt the clotting process.\n\n### 3. Clean the Wound\nOnce the bleeding has stopped or slowed:\n*   **Wash Hands:** Clean your own hands thoroughly with soap and water to avoid introducing bacteria.\n*   **Rinse the Cut:** Use cool, clean running water to rinse out dirt and debris.\n*   **Clean Around the Wound:** Use soap and a washcloth to clean the skin *around* the cut. Try to avoid getting soap directly inside the deep part of the wound, as it can cause irritation.\n*   **Remove Debris:** If there are small pieces of dirt or debris that you cannot remove by rinsing, use sterilized tweezers (cleaned with alcohol) to pick them out.\n\n### 4. Protect the Wound\n*   **Apply Antibiotic Ointment:** Apply a thin layer of an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment (like Neosporin or Bacitracin) if you are not allergic. This helps keep the wound moist and prevents infection.\n*   **Cover it:** Cover the cut with a sterile bandage or adhesive strip. Change the bandage at least once a day or whenever it gets wet or dirty.\n\n---\n\n## When to Seek Medical Attention\nYou should see a doctor or visit urgent care if:\n*   **The bleeding is heavy or does not stop** after 10\u201315 minutes of applied pressure.\n*   **The cut is deep or jagged** (e.g., you can see fat, muscle, or bone, or the edges of the skin are far apart).\n*   **The wound is caused by a dirty or rusty object** (You may need a tetanus shot).\n*   **There is numbness or loss of function** in the area below the wound (this may indicate nerve or tendon damage).\n*   **Signs of infection develop:** Redness spreading from the wound, increasing pain, warmth, swelling, or oozing pus.",

    "problem": "what is narcolepsy",
    "solution": "Although I am an AI assistant designed specifically for the **first_aid** domain, I must clarify that **narcolepsy** is a chronic neurological sleep disorder, not a physical injury or a condition typically managed with first aid.\n\nBased on the patterns available in my knowledge base\u2014specifically **Understanding Cuts and Scrapes: A First Aid Guide** and **what do I do if I cut myself?**\u2014my expertise is focused on trauma care, wound management, and emergency response.\n\nHere is an explanation of narcolepsy, along with important distinctions regarding when first aid might be necessary for someone with this condition.\n\n### What is Narcolepsy?\n\nNarcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. People with narcolepsy experience uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the day. They may also suffer from sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.\n\n**Key Symptoms:**\n*   **Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS):** An overwhelming sense of tiredness, regardless of how much sleep was had the night before.\n*   **Cataplexy:** A sudden loss of muscle tone that leads to feelings of weakness and a loss of voluntary muscle control. It is often triggered by strong emotions like laughter, surprise, or anger.\n*   **Sleep Paralysis:** A temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up.\n*   **Hallucinations:** Vivid and often frightening experiences that occur when falling asleep (hypnagogic) or waking up (hypnopompic).\n\n### First Aid Considerations\n\nWhile narcolepsy itself requires management by a medical professional (usually a neurologist or sleep specialist), there are situations where **first aid** knowledge becomes relevant for a person with narcolepsy.\n\n**1. Injuries from Falls (Cataplexy)**\nIf a person experiences a sudden episode of cataplexy (loss of muscle tone), they may collapse suddenly. This can lead to **cuts, scrapes, or lacerations**.\n*   If a person falls and suffers a cut, you should follow standard first aid protocols.\n*   As described in **what do I do if I cut myself?**, you should:\n    *   **Ensure Safety:** Stop any activity that caused the injury.\n    *   **Control the Bleeding:** Apply firm, direct pressure with a clean cloth.\n    *   **Clean the Wound:** Once bleeding stops, clean the area to prevent infection.\n\n**2. Managing Wounds**\nBecause a person with narcolepsy may be prone to sudden falls, understanding proper wound care is essential. As outlined in **Understanding Cuts and Scrapes: A First Aid Guide**, the skin is the body's primary defense against infection. Any break in the skin (laceration) requires attention to ensure it heals correctly.\n\n**Summary**\nNarcolepsy is a long-term medical condition rather than a first aid emergency. However, if you are with someone who has narcolepsy, the most helpful first aid skills you can possess are treating injuries resulting from unexpected falls, such as **controlling bleeding** and **cleaning wounds**.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI assistant. If you or someone else has experienced a serious injury or has symptoms of narcolepsy, please consult a medical doctor or sleep specialist for proper diagnosis and treatment.*",
