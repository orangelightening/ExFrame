    "solution": "If you have cut yourself, follow these standard first aid steps to manage the wound and prevent infection. **Please remember: I am an AI, not a doctor. If the injury is severe, please call emergency services (911 in the US) or go to the nearest emergency room immediately.**\n\n### 1. Ensure Safety\nStop whatever you are doing. If the cut was caused by a dirty object (like a rusty nail or glass), be careful not to injure yourself further.\n\n### 2. Control the Bleeding\n*   **Apply Pressure:** Use a clean cloth, gauze, or sterile bandage to apply firm, direct pressure to the wound.\n*   **Elevate:** If possible, raise the injured area above the level of the heart. This helps reduce blood flow to the area and slows bleeding.\n*   **Maintain Pressure:** Do not peek to check if the bleeding has stopped for at least 5\u201310 minutes. Removing pressure too soon can disrupt the clotting process.\n\n### 3. Clean the Wound\nOnce the bleeding has stopped or slowed:\n*   **Wash Hands:** Clean your own hands thoroughly with soap and water to avoid introducing bacteria.\n*   **Rinse the Cut:** Use cool, clean running water to rinse out dirt and debris.\n*   **Clean Around the Wound:** Use soap and a washcloth to clean the skin *around* the cut. Try to avoid getting soap directly inside the deep part of the wound, as it can cause irritation.\n*   **Remove Debris:** If there are small pieces of dirt or debris that you cannot remove by rinsing, use sterilized tweezers (cleaned with alcohol) to pick them out.\n\n### 4. Protect the Wound\n*   **Apply Antibiotic Ointment:** Apply a thin layer of an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment (like Neosporin or Bacitracin) if you are not allergic. This helps keep the wound moist and prevents infection.\n*   **Cover it:** Cover the cut with a sterile bandage or adhesive strip. Change the bandage at least once a day or whenever it gets wet or dirty.\n\n---\n\n## When to Seek Medical Attention\nYou should see a doctor or visit urgent care if:\n*   **The bleeding is heavy or does not stop** after 10\u201315 minutes of applied pressure.\n*   **The cut is deep or jagged** (e.g., you can see fat, muscle, or bone, or the edges of the skin are far apart).\n*   **The wound is caused by a dirty or rusty object** (You may need a tetanus shot).\n*   **There is numbness or loss of function** in the area below the wound (this may indicate nerve or tendon damage).\n*   **Signs of infection develop:** Redness spreading from the wound, increasing pain, warmth, swelling, or oozing pus.",
