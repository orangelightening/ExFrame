    "solution": "Building a simple shelf is a fantastic DIY project. Because I don't know the exact size or location you need, I will guide you through building a **basic, single floating shelf**. This design is sturdy, requires minimal tools, and can be adapted to a closet, garage, or living room.\n\n### 1. Gather Your Tools and Materials\n\n**Tools:**\n*   **Drill/Driver:** For driving screws and pre-drilling holes.\n*   **Drill Bits:** A standard driver bit for screws and a **twist drill bit** slightly thinner than your screw shank (for pre-drilling to prevent splitting).\n*   **Level:** Essential for ensuring the shelf sits flat.\n*   **Tape Measure:** For measuring the wall and wood.\n*   **Pencil:** For marking lines.\n*   **Stud Finder:** Highly recommended for heavy items.\n*   **Saw:** If you need to cut your wood to size (a circular saw, jigsaw, or hand saw will work).\n\n**Materials:**\n*   **Wood:** 1\" x 6\" or 1\" x 8\" common board (pine is cheap and easy to work with). Length depends on your space.\n*   **Finish:** Sandpaper (medium and fine grit), wood stain or paint, and polyurethane (optional).\n*   **Hardware:**\n    *   Screws: 2-inch wood screws (for attaching the bracket).\n    *   Screws: 1.5-inch or shorter screws (for mounting to studs).\n    *   **French Cleat (Recommended):** This is the easiest way to hang a shelf securely. It consists of two interlocking pieces of wood. You can buy a metal \"Z-clip\" or make one out of a 1x4.\n    *   *Alternative:* Heavy-duty L-brackets (2 per shelf).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions\n\nHere is how to build a standard floating shelf using the **French Cleat** method (often called a \"Z-clip\" or \"strip bracket\" when made of metal, but wood works great too).\n\n#### Step 1: Cut and Finish the Wood\n1.  **Cut:** Cut your shelf board to your desired length (e.g., 24 inches, 36 inches).\n2.  **Sand:** Smooth the edges and faces using sandpaper. Start with a rougher grit (80-120) and finish with a fine grit (220) for a smooth touch.\n3.  **Finish:** Apply your stain or paint now *before* hanging. It is much easier to finish a shelf lying on a table than one attached to a wall.\n\n#### Step 2: Prepare the Hanging Mechanism (The Cleat)\n*Note: This is the simplest method for beginners because it locks the shelf onto the wall.*\n\n1.  **The Wall Strip:** Take a scrap piece of wood (like a 1x4) cut to the length of your shelf (or slightly shorter). This will be screwed to the wall.\n2.  **The Shelf Strip:** Take another piece of identical size.\n3.  **The Angle:** Using your saw or a table saw, cut both pieces at a **45-degree angle** along the length.\n    *   One piece will look like an \"L\" (if you stand it up).\n    *   The other piece will be the reverse \"L\".\n4.  **Attach to Shelf:** Take the piece that has the **flat back** and the angled cut facing *down/inward*. Screw this piece into the top, back edge of your finished shelf board. Use wood glue and short screws.\n\n#### Step 3: Find the Studs and Mount\n1.  **Locate Studs:** Use your stud finder to locate the wooden studs behind your drywall. Mark their center points with a pencil. Draw a level horizontal line where you want the shelf to sit.\n2.  **Mount the Wall Strip:** Align the *other* piece of your cleat (the part with the angle cut *upward/outward*) with your level line.\n3.  **Pre-Drill:** Drill pilot holes through the cleat and into the wall studs.\n4.  **Secure:** Drive long screws (at least 2.5 inches) through the cleat into the studs. **Do not rely only on drywall anchors for shelves**; they will likely pull out over time.\n\n#### Step 4: Hang the Shelf\n1.  Simply lift your finished shelf board and place the cleat attached to the shelf *over* the cleat attached to the wall.\n2.  The angled cuts should lock together. The weight of the shelf pulls it tight against the wall.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Alternative: The \"L-Bracket\" Method\nIf you don't want to cut angles for a cleat, use **L-Brackets**.\n\n1.
