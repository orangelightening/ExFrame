    "solution": "Based on the provided search results, there is no direct definition of \"ExFrame\" (e.g., as a software framework or specific product name) in the text. However, the results strongly imply that **ExFrame** is the name of the knowledge management system or platform you are currently using, which organizes information into **Domains** and **Patterns** to solve specific problems.\n\nHere is what can be inferred about ExFrame from the search results:\n\n### 1. Core Concept: Domains\nThe system organizes knowledge into distinct areas called \"Domains.\" The provided text lists examples such as:\n*   **Cooking Domain:** Contains patterns for recipes, food techniques, and troubleshooting (e.g., \"How do I cook chicken breast?\").\n*   **Python Domain:** Contains patterns for coding, LLM monitoring, and autonomous agents (e.g., \"How do I detect when an LLM is hallucinating?\").\n*   *Source 1 & 3 mention: \"Domains are areas of expe...\"*\n\n### 2. Knowledge Representation: Patterns\nInformation within ExFrame is structured into \"Patterns.\" According to **Source 2**, each pattern contains specific metadata fields:\n*   **Name:** A brief title.\n*   **Type:** The category of the pattern (e.g., recipe, technique, code).\n*   **Description:** What the pattern does.\n*   **Problem:** The specific issue the pattern addresses.\n*   **Solution:** The answer or implementation.\n*   **Status:** Indicates if the pattern is \"Certified\" (\u2713) or a \"Candidate\" (?).\n*   **Confidence:** A quality score ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.\n\n### 3. User Interface\nThe text describes a specific user interface for interacting with this knowledge base, including:\n*   **Patterns Tab:** Used to browse and filter patterns by domain or category.\n*   **Sources Tab:** Used to search across all domains and view usage statistics.\n\n### Summary\n**ExFrame** appears to be an expert system or knowledge framework that captures solutions as reusable \"Patterns\" categorized by \"Domains.\" It is designed to help users query specific problems (like \"My cake is too dense\") and retrieve certified solutions with associated confidence scores.",

According to **Source 1**, the process involves the following settings:\n\n*   **Targets**:\n    *   **Target Patterns**: You determine how many patterns the system should attempt to collect.\n    *   **Min Confidence**: You set a minimum quality threshold for the results (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0).\n*   **Neighbourhood Definition**: You can define a \"Neighbourhood,\" which acts as a user-defined filter to search across all available domains.\n*   **Action**: Once these settings are input, you click **Create Survey** to initiate the process.\n\n### Understanding Results\nWhile the documents do not explain the exact algorithm the surveyor uses to traverse the data, **Source 3** explains how to interpret the output of queries (which may be related to the survey results):\n*   **Confidence**: The system provides a confidence score (0-100%) indicating how reliable the answer is.\n*   **Specialist**: It indicates which AI specialist handled the query.\n*   **Patterns Used**: It lists which knowledge patterns were referenced to generate the response.\n\n**Note:** The specific mechanics of how the surveyor executes the search\u2014such as how it identifies \"Neighbourhoods\" or how it validates patterns against the Min Confidence threshold\u2014are not detailed in the provided text segments.",

    "solution": "Based on the provided documentation, the EEFrame architecture is defined by a **universe-based design** coupled with a **plugin-based pipeline** intended for creating domain-agnostic AI knowledge assistants.\n\nHere are the key architectural components identified in the search results:\n\n### 1. Universe Architecture\nAccording to **Source 3 (README.md)**, the core of EEFrame's design is its \"Universe Architecture.\" This feature ensures:\n*   **Complete isolation**: Knowledge configurations are kept distinct.\n*   **Portability**: Knowledge configurations can be easily moved or managed independently.\n\n### 2. Plugin-Based Pipeline\n**Source 3** describes a modular, plugin-based pipeline for processing data. The flow follows this sequence:\n> `Router \u2192 Specialist \u2192 Enricher \u2192 Formatter`\n\nThis pipeline allows the system to route queries, specialize processing, enrich data, and format outputs through distinct, interchangeable plugins.\n\n### 3. Autonomous Learning System (Current Focus)\n**Source 2 (context.md)** outlines a specific architectural focus for the project's development: an **Autonomous Learning and Certification System**. This part of the architecture is designed to:\n*   **Autonomously Scrape**: Ingest data from web sources.\n*   **Extract**: Identify knowledge patterns.\n*   **Certify**: Validate patterns using a **5-judge AI panel**.\n*   **Store**: Save validated expertise.\n*   **Future Integration**: Includes hooks for a future \"Research Generator.\"\n\n### 4. Domain Agnostic\n**Source 3** emphasizes that the framework is **domain-agnostic**, meaning it is built to manage AI-powered knowledge for any specific field or subject area without being hardcoded for one specific topic.\n\n*Note: While **Source 1 (user-guide.md)** lists sections for features like the \"Query Assistant,\" \"Pattern Management,\" and \"Universes,\" the search results provided do not contain the detailed text for those specific sections to further explain the architecture.*",

    "problem": "EEFrame domains and patterns",
    "solution": "Based on the search results, here is an overview of **EEFrame domains and patterns** within the context of the framework's architecture and capabilities.\n\n### Overview\n**EEFrame** (Expertise Framework) is a domain-agnostic, AI-powered knowledge management system. It utilizes a **Universe Architecture** to ensure the complete isolation and portability of knowledge configurations, alongside a plugin-based pipeline for processing information.\n\n### 1. Domains\nIn EEFrame, a **Domain** represents a specific area of knowledge or expertise. The framework is designed to manage these distinct areas effectively:\n\n*   **Domain Management:** EEFrame includes specific functionality dedicated to managing knowledge domains (Source 1). This allows users to segregate and configure different subjects or data sets.\n*   **Single Domain Strategy:** The current development focus involves a \"Single Domain First\" strategy. This approach prioritizes building a robust autonomous learning system within one specific domain before scaling to others, ensuring a strong foundation for knowledge extraction and certification (Source 2).\n\n### 2. Patterns\n**Patterns** in EEFrame refer to extracted units of knowledge or expertise. The framework focuses heavily on the autonomous discovery and validation of these patterns:\n\n*   **Pattern Management:** EEFrame provides dedicated tools for managing the lifecycle of knowledge patterns, ensuring they are organized and accessible (Source 1).\n*   **Autonomous Extraction:** The system is designed to autonomously scrape web sources to extract these knowledge patterns (Source 2).\n*   **Certification:** A key feature of EEFrame is the validation of patterns. Extracted patterns are certified through a **5-judge AI panel**, ensuring that stored expertise is accurate and reliable before being integrated into the system (Source 2).\n\n### Architecture Summary\nThe relationship between domains and patterns is supported by EEFrame's core architecture:\n*   **Universes:** Provide the isolation layer for different knowledge configurations.\n*   **Pipeline:** A plugin-based system (Router \u2192 Specialist \u2192 Enricher) processes the data.\n*   **Surveyor:** An autonomous learning module that drives the extraction and certification of patterns for a specific domain.\n\n**Sources:**\n*   *EEFrame User Guide (Source 1)*\n*   *EEFrame Project Context (Source 2)*\n*   *README.md (Source 3)*",
