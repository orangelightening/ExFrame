    "solution": "Based on the provided search results, there is no direct definition of \"ExFrame\" (e.g., as a software framework or specific product name) in the text. However, the results strongly imply that **ExFrame** is the name of the knowledge management system or platform you are currently using, which organizes information into **Domains** and **Patterns** to solve specific problems.\n\nHere is what can be inferred about ExFrame from the search results:\n\n### 1. Core Concept: Domains\nThe system organizes knowledge into distinct areas called \"Domains.\" The provided text lists examples such as:\n*   **Cooking Domain:** Contains patterns for recipes, food techniques, and troubleshooting (e.g., \"How do I cook chicken breast?\").\n*   **Python Domain:** Contains patterns for coding, LLM monitoring, and autonomous agents (e.g., \"How do I detect when an LLM is hallucinating?\").\n*   *Source 1 & 3 mention: \"Domains are areas of expe...\"*\n\n### 2. Knowledge Representation: Patterns\nInformation within ExFrame is structured into \"Patterns.\" According to **Source 2**, each pattern contains specific metadata fields:\n*   **Name:** A brief title.\n*   **Type:** The category of the pattern (e.g., recipe, technique, code).\n*   **Description:** What the pattern does.\n*   **Problem:** The specific issue the pattern addresses.\n*   **Solution:** The answer or implementation.\n*   **Status:** Indicates if the pattern is \"Certified\" (\u2713) or a \"Candidate\" (?).\n*   **Confidence:** A quality score ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.\n\n### 3. User Interface\nThe text describes a specific user interface for interacting with this knowledge base, including:\n*   **Patterns Tab:** Used to browse and filter patterns by domain or category.\n*   **Sources Tab:** Used to search across all domains and view usage statistics.\n\n### Summary\n**ExFrame** appears to be an expert system or knowledge framework that captures solutions as reusable \"Patterns\" categorized by \"Domains.\" It is designed to help users query specific problems (like \"My cake is too dense\") and retrieve certified solutions with associated confidence scores.",

According to **Source 1**, the process involves the following settings:\n\n*   **Targets**:\n    *   **Target Patterns**: You determine how many patterns the system should attempt to collect.\n    *   **Min Confidence**: You set a minimum quality threshold for the results (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0).\n*   **Neighbourhood Definition**: You can define a \"Neighbourhood,\" which acts as a user-defined filter to search across all available domains.\n*   **Action**: Once these settings are input, you click **Create Survey** to initiate the process.\n\n### Understanding Results\nWhile the documents do not explain the exact algorithm the surveyor uses to traverse the data, **Source 3** explains how to interpret the output of queries (which may be related to the survey results):\n*   **Confidence**: The system provides a confidence score (0-100%) indicating how reliable the answer is.\n*   **Specialist**: It indicates which AI specialist handled the query.\n*   **Patterns Used**: It lists which knowledge patterns were referenced to generate the response.\n\n**Note:** The specific mechanics of how the surveyor executes the search\u2014such as how it identifies \"Neighbourhoods\" or how it validates patterns against the Min Confidence threshold\u2014are not detailed in the provided text segments.",
