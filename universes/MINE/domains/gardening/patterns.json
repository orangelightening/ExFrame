    "solution": "It looks like the information we found in our knowledge base was about pruning tomatoes rather than starting seeds, but I can certainly help you get started with seeding indoors!\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide to starting seeds indoors to ensure your garden gets a head start this season.\n\n### 1. Timing is Everything\nYou don't want to start seeds too early or they will become root-bound and leggy before you can plant them outside.\n*   **Calculate backwards:** Look up the \"last frost date\" for your area.\n*   **Check the seed packet:** Most packets will say something like \"Start indoors 6\u20138 weeks before last frost.\" Count back from your frost date to find your planting window.\n\n### 2. Gather Your Supplies\nYou don't need expensive gear, but you do need the right setup:\n*   **Containers:** You can use plastic cell trays, peat pots, or even recycled egg cartons (just make sure they have drainage holes).\n*   **Seed Starting Mix:** Do **not** use regular garden soil or potting soil. Garden soil is too heavy and can harbor diseases. Use a light, sterile, soilless mix specifically designed for seeds.\n*   **Light:** This is where most people fail. A sunny windowsill is rarely enough. You will likely need grow lights or a strong fluorescent/shop light setup.\n*   **Warmth:** Most seeds need warm soil to germinate (around 65\u201375\u00b0F / 18\u201324\u00b0C).\n\n### 3. Planting Steps\n1.  **Moisten the Mix:** Put your seed starting mix in a bucket and add water until it feels like a wrung-out sponge. It should be damp, not soggy.\n2.  **Fill Containers:** Fill your pots or cells with the damp mix. Tap the container gently to settle the soil\u2014don't pack it down tight.\n3.  **Plant the Seeds:** Check the packet for depth. A general rule of thumb is to plant the seed **twice as deep as the seed is wide**. Tiny seeds might just need to be pressed onto the surface.\n4.  **Label:** Trust me, you will forget which pot is which. Use a waterproof marker.\n\n### 4. The Germination Phase (Keep them Humid)\nUntil the seeds sprout, they need high humidity.\n*   Cover your trays with a clear plastic dome or a piece of plastic wrap to keep moisture in.\n*   Keep them in a warm spot. The top of a refrigerator is often good, or you can buy a seedling heat mat.\n*   **Check daily:** As soon as you see green sprouts poking through the soil, remove the plastic cover immediately and move them under your lights.\n\n### 5. Caring for Seedlings\n*   **Light:** Seedlings need 14\u201316 hours of light a day. Keep the lights very close to the plants (2\u20133 inches away) to prevent them from getting \"leggy\" (tall and spindly).\n*   **Water:** Keep the soil consistently moist but not drowning. Water from the bottom if possible (pour water into the tray and let the soil soak it up) to encourage strong roots.\n*   **Fertilizer:** Once the seedlings have their first set of \"true leaves\" (the second set of leaves that appear), you can start feeding them with a weak, liquid fertilizer at half strength.\n*   **Air Flow:** A small fan on low setting nearby helps strengthen the stems and prevents mold.\n\n### 6. Hardening Off\nBefore planting outside, you must acclimate your plants or they will go into shock.\n*   About a week before you plan to transplant, start taking your plants outside for a few hours a day.\n*   Start in a shady, protected spot and gradually increase their time outside and their exposure to sun over 7\u201310 days.\n\n**Quick Checklist:**\n1.  Calculate your date based on the last frost.\n2.  Use sterile seed starting mix.\n3.  Keep seeds warm and moist until they sprout.\n4.  Move sprouts immediately to bright light.\n5.  Harden them off before the final move outdoors.",

    "problem": "How do I prune tomato plants?",
    "solution": "Pruning tomato plants is a great way to keep your garden tidy and improve the quality of your fruit, but it\u2019s not a \"one size fits all\" task. The most important rule is that **you must identify what kind of tomato you are growing before you make a single cut.**\n\nHere is a guide to help you prune effectively.\n\n### 1. Identify Your Tomato Type\n*   **Determinate (Bush):** These grow to a set height and ripen all their fruit at once.\n    *   **Advice:** Go easy on these. You generally should **not** heavily prune determinates, or you will reduce your harvest. Only remove damaged leaves or the very bottom branches to improve airflow.\n*   **Indeterminate (Vining):** These continue growing and producing fruit until the frost hits them.\n    *   **Advice:** These **require pruning**. Without it, they turn into a tangled jungle that focuses energy on leaves rather than fruit.\n\n### 2. Identify the \"Suckers\"\nMost pruning involves removing \"suckers.\"\n*   **What to look for:** These are small shoots that grow in the \"V\" shape (axil) between the main stem and a leaf branch.\n*   **The Goal:** If left alone, a sucker becomes a whole new main stem. By removing them, you direct the plant's energy into growing larger, tastier fruit rather than more foliage.\n\n### 3. Pruning Techniques (For Indeterminate Plants)\nYou have two main options depending on how much space you have:\n\n*   **The Single Stem Method:** Ideal for small spaces. Identify the main stem and pinch off **every** sucker you see. This keeps the plant vertical and compact.\n*   **The Double or Triple Stem Method:** If you want a bushier plant or insurance against sunscald, let the first sucker directly **below** the first flower cluster grow. This becomes a second main stem. You can let one more below that grow for a third stem. Remove all other suckers.\n\n### 4. Maintenance & Cleanup\nNo matter what type you have, these steps keep the plant healthy:\n\n*   **Clear the Bottom:** As the plant grows, pinch off the bottom leaves so the bottom 6\u201310 inches of the stem are bare. This prevents soil-borne diseases from splashing onto the leaves during watering.\n*   **The \"Missouri Pruning\" (Optional):** If you want to keep a sucker but stop it from growing huge, pinch off just the *tip* of the sucker, leaving one or two leaves behind. This shades the fruit without producing a new stem.\n*   **Remove Yellow/Dead Leaves:** If you see yellowing or spotted leaves, pluck them immediately to stop the spread of disease.\n\n### 5. Late Season \"Top Off\"\nAbout 4 weeks before your first expected frost, cut the very top growing tip of the main stem. This signals the plant to stop growing new leaves and directs all remaining energy into ripening the existing fruit.\n\n**Quick Checklist:**\n1.  Only heavily prune **Indeterminate** varieties.\n2.  Pinch suckers when they are small (2\u20133 inches).\n3.  Sanitize your shears (or wash hands) between plants to avoid spreading disease.\n4.  Never remove more than 25\u201330% of the plant's foliage at once.",

    "problem": "What is borage and can you eat it?",
    "solution": "It looks like the information we found in our knowledge base was about pruning tomatoes rather than borage, but I can certainly tell you everything you need to know about this fascinating plant!\n\n**What is Borage?**\nBorage (*Borago officinalis*) is an easy-to-grow annual herb that is famous for its brilliant blue, star-shaped flowers. Because the flowers hang downward in clusters, the plant is often affectionately called \"starflower.\" It is a favorite among gardeners not just for its looks, but because it is a \"workhorse\" in the garden\u2014it attracts bees and other pollinators while improving the soil.\n\n**Can You Eat It?**\n**Yes, absolutely!** Borage is entirely edible, from its fuzzy leaves to its beautiful flowers. It has a distinct flavor profile that is quite unique.\n\nHere is a guide on how to enjoy it:\n\n### 1. The Flavor Profile\n*   **The Taste:** Borage is famous for tasting exactly like **cucumber**. It is fresh, cool, and slightly crisp.\n*   **The Aroma:** The leaves and flowers have a mild, refreshing scent.\n\n### 2. How to Eat the Flowers\nThe flowers are the most popular part of the plant to eat because they are visually stunning and lack the fuzziness of the leaves.\n*   **Garnish:** They are beautiful floating in cold drinks (like lemonade or iced tea) or placed on top of cakes and desserts.\n*   **Candied Flowers:** You can candy the flowers by brushing them with egg white and dusting them with sugar. This creates a stunning, sparkling decoration for baked goods.\n*   **Salads:** Toss them into spring salads for a pop of blue color and a cucumber crunch.\n*   **Frozen in Ice:** Freeze the flowers inside ice cube trays for a fancy addition to summer beverages.\n\n### 3. How to Eat the Leaves\nWhile the leaves are edible, they are covered in small, prickly hairs. It is best to process them before eating.\n*   **Cooking:** The hairs usually dissolve when cooked. You can treat borage leaves like a spinach or greens. Saut\u00e9 them or add them to soups and stews.\n*   **Raw:** If eating raw, it is highly recommended to **chop them finely** so you don't feel the prickly texture. They work well blended into dips, pestos, or cream cheese spreads.\n*   **Tea:** The leaves can be dried and steeped to make a refreshing, cucumber-flavored herbal tea.\n\n### A Few Safety Tips\n*   **The Fuzz:** As mentioned, the leaves can be irritating to the throat due to the fine hairs. Always blend or cook them if you find the texture unpleasant.\n*   **Pregnancy and Nursing:** While borage is a traditional culinary herb, it contains small amounts of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids (which can be toxic to the liver in very large amounts). It is generally advised that pregnant or nursing women, or those with liver issues, avoid consuming borage in large medicinal quantities, though culinary use (a few leaves or flowers) is generally considered safe for most people. As always, if you are unsure, consult a doctor.",

Harden them off before the final move outdoors.\n\n---\n\n# What is a Nasturtium?\n\nA **nasturtium** (*Tropaeolum majus*) is a fast-growing, cheerful plant that is a favorite among gardeners for its versatility. It is typically grown as an annual, though in mild climates (Zones 9\u201311), it can survive as a perennial.\n\nHere is what makes them special:\n\n*   **Edible:** Nasturtiums are famous for being completely edible (and they taste great!). The flowers and leaves have a distinct, peppery flavor similar to watercress or radishes. Chefs often use the bright blooms to add color and a \"kick\" to salads, summer drinks, and as garnishes.\n*   **Companion Planting:** They are excellent companion plants for vegetables. Gardeners often plant them near tomatoes, cucumbers, and squash to deter pests like aphids, whiteflies, and squash beetles.\n*   **Easy to Grow:** They are very forgiving and thrive in poor soil. In fact, if you give them rich, fertile soil, they tend to produce lots of leaves but very few flowers. They prefer a little neglect!\n*   **Varieties:** You can find **trailing** varieties (perfect for hanging baskets or ground cover) and **bush** varieties (better for garden borders or containers).\n\n---\n\n# How Much Do the Seeds Cost?\n\nNasturtium seeds are generally very affordable. Because the seeds are large (about the size of a dried pea) and easy to harvest, they are cost-effective to produce.\n\nHere is a general breakdown of what you can expect to pay:\n\n*   **Small Packets (Standard):** At most garden centers or big-box stores, a standard packet containing 20\u201350 seeds usually costs between **$2.00 and $4.00 USD**.\n*   **Heirloom or Organic Varieties:** If you are buying from a specialty seed catalog or looking for specific heirloom varieties (like 'Empress of India' or 'Alaska Mix'), the price might be slightly higher, around **$3.50 to $5.00 USD**.\n*   **Bulk:** If you have a large area to cover, you can buy them in bulk, which significantly drops the price per seed.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Nasturtiums seed themselves readily. If you plant them once, they will often drop seeds in the fall and pop up again on their own the next spring, giving you free plants in future years",

    "domain": "gardening",
    "problem": "What are shrubs to grow on Vancouver Island that deer do not like to eat?",
    "solution": "Based on general horticultural knowledge of deer-resistant plants suitable for the Pacific Northwest climate of Vancouver Island, here are shrubs that are typically less palatable to deer:\n\n**Highly Deer-Resistant Shrubs (due to toxicity, strong scent, or texture):**\n\n1.  **Rhododendron & Azalea** (*Rhododendron spp.*): Most varieties contain toxins that deer avoid. Evergreen and flowering.\n2.  **Oregon Grape** (*Mahonia aquifolium*): A native evergreen with holly-like leaves, yellow flowers, and blue berries. The prickly leaves are a strong deterrent.\n3.  **Sword Fern** (*Polystichum munitum*): While a fern, it forms large, dense clumps that function as a shrub-like barrier. Deer rarely browse it.\n4.  **Daphne** (*Daphne spp.*): All parts are poisonous and strongly avoided. Fragrant flowers. (Note: All parts are also toxic to pets and humans).\n5.  **Boxwood** (*Buxus spp.*): The dense foliage and strong scent are unappealing to deer. Excellent for hedging.\n6.  **Pieris** (*Pieris japonica*): Also known as Lily-of-the-Valley Shrub. Contains toxins that make it deer-resistant. Attractive evergreen with cascading flowers.\n7.  **Heavenly Bamboo** (*Nandina domestica*): Berries and foliage are generally avoided. Provides year-round interest.\n8.  **Rosemary** (*Rosalmarinus officinalis*): The strong aromatic oils are a natural deer repellent. Prefers sunny, well-drained spots.\n9.  **Lavender** (*Lavandula spp.*): Like rosemary, its strong scent deters deer. Requires full sun and good drainage.\n10. **Sarcococca** (*Sarcococca spp.*): Sweet Box or Christmas Box. A shade-tolerant evergreen with tiny, powerfully fragrant winter flowers. Deer avoid it.\n11. **Japanese Skimmia** (*Skimmia japonica*): An evergreen shade shrub with fragrant flowers and red berries. Deer tend to leave it alone.\n12. **Ceanothus** (*Ceanothus spp.*): Many varieties, like the native *Ceanothus velutinus* (Snowbrush), have leaves deer dislike. Prefers sun.\n\n**Important Considerations for Vancouver Island:**\n\n*   **Deer Pressure:** In areas with high deer populations and scarce food, **no plant is 100% deer-proof**. Young, newly planted shrubs are most vulnerable and may need protection (e.g., cages, repellents) until established.\n*   **Climate Zones:** Vancouver Island ranges from mild coastal (Zone 8-9) to cooler mountainous areas. Ensure the shrub is suited to your specific hardiness zone.\n*   **Native Plants:** Choosing natives like **Oregon Grape**, **Tall Oregon Grape** (*Mahonia nervosa*), and **Salal** (*Gaultheria shallon*) is ecologically beneficial. While deer may occasionally browse Salal, it's often considered moderately resistant and recovers well.\n*   **Texture & Aroma:** Deer typically avoid plants with:\n    *   **Prickly or fuzzy leaves** (e.g., Oregon Grape).\n    *   **Strong aromatic oils** (e.g., Lavender, Rosemary, Sage).\n    *   **Toxic properties** (e.g., Daphne, Rhododendron, Pieris).\n*   **Local Nurseries:** The best advice often comes from local garden centers. Ask for **\"deer-resistant\"** shrubs that thrive in your specific area of the Island.\n\n**Shrubs to Generally Avoid** if deer are a major concern, as they are highly palatable: Hostas, Roses, Hydrangeas (except *Hydrangea paniculata* may be slightly more resistant), Fruit-bearing shrubs like Blueberries, and most young deciduous trees like Japanese Maples.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** For a reliable, low-maintenance start, consider **Oregon Grape**, **Rhododendron**, **Pieris**, or **Boxwood**. Always layer strategies\u2014combining resistant plants with occasional repellents or physical barriers for new plantings yields the best results.",
