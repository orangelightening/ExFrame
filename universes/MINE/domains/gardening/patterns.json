    "solution": "Pruning tomato plants is an excellent way to improve plant health, increase fruit size, and keep the garden manageable. However, the method depends entirely on the **type** of tomato you are growing.\n\nHere is a guide on how to prune effectively.\n\n### 1. Identify Your Tomato Type\nBefore you make a single cut, you must know if your tomato is **Determinate** or **Indeterminate**.\n\n*   **Determinate (Bush):** These grow to a set height, set all their fruit at once, and then stop growing.\n    *   **To Prune or Not?** Generally, **do not** heavily prune determinates. You can remove damaged leaves or the very bottom branches for airflow, but heavy pruning will reduce your harvest.\n*   **Indeterminate (Vining):** These continue growing, blooming, and setting fruit until frost kills them. They can become huge and unruly.\n    *   **To Prune or Not?** **Yes.** These require regular pruning to keep them under control and direct energy into fruit production rather than foliage.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Identify the \"Suckers\"\nThe main part of pruning involves removing \"suckers.\"\n*   **What are they?** Suckers are small shoots that grow in the \"V\" crotch (axil) between the main stem and a leaf branch.\n*   **Why remove them?** If left alone, a sucker becomes a whole new main stem with its own leaves and fruit. This creates a dense jungle that shades leaves (reducing photosynthesis) and delays ripening.\n\n### 3. Pruning Techniques for Indeterminate Tomatoes\n\n**The Simple Method: Single Stem**\nIf you have limited space or want large fruit, prune so there is only **one main vertical stem**.\n*   **How to do it:** Identify the main stem. Pinch or snip off *every* sucker you see below the top cluster of flowers.\n\n**The Double or Triple Stem Method**\nFor insurance against sunscald or if you want a slightly bushier plant, you can leave 1 or 2 suckers to grow.\n*   **How to do it:** Let the first sucker directly **below** the first flower cluster grow. This will become a second main stem. You can also let the sucker below *that* one grow for a third stem. Remove all other suckers.\n\n### 4. General Maintenance Pruning\nRegardless of the variety, all tomatoes benefit from these maintenance cuts:\n\n*   **The \"Missouri Pruning\" (optional):** If you let suckers grow, you can pinch just the *tip* of the sucker off, leaving one or two leaves behind. This keeps the plant leafy (to shade fruit) but stops new stem growth.\n*   **Clear the Bottom:** As the plant grows, remove the bottom-most leaves. Ideally, the bottom 6\u201310 inches of the stem should be bare. This prevents soil-borne pathogens from splashing onto the leaves during rain or watering.\n*   **Remove Yellow/Diseased Leaves:** If leaves are yellowing, spotted, or dying, remove them immediately to prevent the spread of disease.\n\n### 5. The \"Top Off\" (Late Season)\nAbout 4 weeks before your first expected frost date, you should \"top\" the plant.\n*   Cut the terminal growing tip of the main stem(s).\n*   This signals the plant to stop growing new vegetation and directs all remaining energy into ripening the existing fruit.\n\n### Summary Checklist\n1.  **Check variety:** Only heavily prune **Indeterminate** types.\n2.  **Locate suckers:** Find shoots growing between stem and leaf.\n3.  **Pinch or Cut:** Remove suckers when they are small (2\u20133 inches long). You can pinch them with your fingers or use sharp shears.\n4.  **Sanitize:** If using tools, wipe them with rubbing alcohol between plants to avoid spreading disease.\n5.  **Don't overdo it:** Never remove more than 25-30% of the plant's foliage at once.",

    "problem": "How do I start seeds indoors?",
    "solution": "It looks like the information we found in our knowledge base was about pruning tomatoes rather than starting seeds, but I can certainly help you get started with seeding indoors!\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide to starting seeds indoors to ensure your garden gets a head start this season.\n\n### 1. Timing is Everything\nYou don't want to start seeds too early or they will become root-bound and leggy before you can plant them outside.\n*   **Calculate backwards:** Look up the \"last frost date\" for your area.\n*   **Check the seed packet:** Most packets will say something like \"Start indoors 6\u20138 weeks before last frost.\" Count back from your frost date to find your planting window.\n\n### 2. Gather Your Supplies\nYou don't need expensive gear, but you do need the right setup:\n*   **Containers:** You can use plastic cell trays, peat pots, or even recycled egg cartons (just make sure they have drainage holes).\n*   **Seed Starting Mix:** Do **not** use regular garden soil or potting soil. Garden soil is too heavy and can harbor diseases. Use a light, sterile, soilless mix specifically designed for seeds.\n*   **Light:** This is where most people fail. A sunny windowsill is rarely enough. You will likely need grow lights or a strong fluorescent/shop light setup.\n*   **Warmth:** Most seeds need warm soil to germinate (around 65\u201375\u00b0F / 18\u201324\u00b0C).\n\n### 3. Planting Steps\n1.  **Moisten the Mix:** Put your seed starting mix in a bucket and add water until it feels like a wrung-out sponge. It should be damp, not soggy.\n2.  **Fill Containers:** Fill your pots or cells with the damp mix. Tap the container gently to settle the soil\u2014don't pack it down tight.\n3.  **Plant the Seeds:** Check the packet for depth. A general rule of thumb is to plant the seed **twice as deep as the seed is wide**. Tiny seeds might just need to be pressed onto the surface.\n4.  **Label:** Trust me, you will forget which pot is which. Use a waterproof marker.\n\n### 4. The Germination Phase (Keep them Humid)\nUntil the seeds sprout, they need high humidity.\n*   Cover your trays with a clear plastic dome or a piece of plastic wrap to keep moisture in.\n*   Keep them in a warm spot. The top of a refrigerator is often good, or you can buy a seedling heat mat.\n*   **Check daily:** As soon as you see green sprouts poking through the soil, remove the plastic cover immediately and move them under your lights.\n\n### 5. Caring for Seedlings\n*   **Light:** Seedlings need 14\u201316 hours of light a day. Keep the lights very close to the plants (2\u20133 inches away) to prevent them from getting \"leggy\" (tall and spindly).\n*   **Water:** Keep the soil consistently moist but not drowning. Water from the bottom if possible (pour water into the tray and let the soil soak it up) to encourage strong roots.\n*   **Fertilizer:** Once the seedlings have their first set of \"true leaves\" (the second set of leaves that appear), you can start feeding them with a weak, liquid fertilizer at half strength.\n*   **Air Flow:** A small fan on low setting nearby helps strengthen the stems and prevents mold.\n\n### 6. Hardening Off\nBefore planting outside, you must acclimate your plants or they will go into shock.\n*   About a week before you plan to transplant, start taking your plants outside for a few hours a day.\n*   Start in a shady, protected spot and gradually increase their time outside and their exposure to sun over 7\u201310 days.\n\n**Quick Checklist:**\n1.  Calculate your date based on the last frost.\n2.  Use sterile seed starting mix.\n3.  Keep seeds warm and moist until they sprout.\n4.  Move sprouts immediately to bright light.\n5.  Harden them off before the final move outdoors.",

    "problem": "What is borage and can you eat it?",
    "solution": "It looks like the information we found in our knowledge base was about pruning tomatoes rather than borage, but I can certainly tell you everything you need to know about this fascinating plant!\n\n**What is Borage?**\nBorage (*Borago officinalis*) is an easy-to-grow annual herb that is famous for its brilliant blue, star-shaped flowers. Because the flowers hang downward in clusters, the plant is often affectionately called \"starflower.\" It is a favorite among gardeners not just for its looks, but because it is a \"workhorse\" in the garden\u2014it attracts bees and other pollinators while improving the soil.\n\n**Can You Eat It?**\n**Yes, absolutely!** Borage is entirely edible, from its fuzzy leaves to its beautiful flowers. It has a distinct flavor profile that is quite unique.\n\nHere is a guide on how to enjoy it:\n\n### 1. The Flavor Profile\n*   **The Taste:** Borage is famous for tasting exactly like **cucumber**. It is fresh, cool, and slightly crisp.\n*   **The Aroma:** The leaves and flowers have a mild, refreshing scent.\n\n### 2. How to Eat the Flowers\nThe flowers are the most popular part of the plant to eat because they are visually stunning and lack the fuzziness of the leaves.\n*   **Garnish:** They are beautiful floating in cold drinks (like lemonade or iced tea) or placed on top of cakes and desserts.\n*   **Candied Flowers:** You can candy the flowers by brushing them with egg white and dusting them with sugar. This creates a stunning, sparkling decoration for baked goods.\n*   **Salads:** Toss them into spring salads for a pop of blue color and a cucumber crunch.\n*   **Frozen in Ice:** Freeze the flowers inside ice cube trays for a fancy addition to summer beverages.\n\n### 3. How to Eat the Leaves\nWhile the leaves are edible, they are covered in small, prickly hairs. It is best to process them before eating.\n*   **Cooking:** The hairs usually dissolve when cooked. You can treat borage leaves like a spinach or greens. Saut\u00e9 them or add them to soups and stews.\n*   **Raw:** If eating raw, it is highly recommended to **chop them finely** so you don't feel the prickly texture. They work well blended into dips, pestos, or cream cheese spreads.\n*   **Tea:** The leaves can be dried and steeped to make a refreshing, cucumber-flavored herbal tea.\n\n### A Few Safety Tips\n*   **The Fuzz:** As mentioned, the leaves can be irritating to the throat due to the fine hairs. Always blend or cook them if you find the texture unpleasant.\n*   **Pregnancy and Nursing:** While borage is a traditional culinary herb, it contains small amounts of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids (which can be toxic to the liver in very large amounts). It is generally advised that pregnant or nursing women, or those with liver issues, avoid consuming borage in large medicinal quantities, though culinary use (a few leaves or flowers) is generally considered safe for most people. As always, if you are unsure, consult a doctor.",

It is typically grown as an annual, though in mild climates (Zones 9\u201311), it can survive as a perennial.\n\nHere is what makes them special:\n\n*   **Edible:** Nasturtiums are famous for being completely edible (and they taste great!). The flowers and leaves have a distinct, peppery flavor similar to watercress or radishes. Chefs often use the bright blooms to add color and a \"kick\" to salads, summer drinks, and as garnishes.\n*   **Companion Planting:** They are excellent companion plants for vegetables. Gardeners often plant them near tomatoes, cucumbers, and squash to deter pests like aphids, whiteflies, and squash beetles.\n*   **Easy to Grow:** They are very forgiving and thrive in poor soil. In fact, if you give them rich, fertile soil, they tend to produce lots of leaves but very few flowers. They prefer a little neglect!\n*   **Varieties:** You can find **trailing** varieties (perfect for hanging baskets or ground cover) and **bush** varieties (better for garden borders or containers).\n\n---\n\n# How Much Do the Seeds Cost?\n\nNasturtium seeds are generally very affordable. Because the seeds are large (about the size of a dried pea) and easy to harvest, they are cost-effective to produce.\n\nHere is a general breakdown of what you can expect to pay:\n\n*   **Small Packets (Standard):** At most garden centers or big-box stores, a standard packet containing 20\u201350 seeds usually costs between **$2.00 and $4.00 USD**.\n*   **Heirloom or Organic Varieties:** If you are buying from a specialty seed catalog or looking for specific heirloom varieties (like 'Empress of India' or 'Alaska Mix'), the price might be slightly higher, around **$3.50 to $5.00 USD**.\n*   **Bulk:** If you have a large area to cover, you can buy them in bulk, which significantly drops the price per seed.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Nasturtiums seed themselves readily. If you plant them once, they will often drop seeds in the fall and pop up again on their own the next spring, giving you free plants in future years",
