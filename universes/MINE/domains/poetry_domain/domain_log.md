Query: Write me a poem about yin and yang. question and answer, 

**Question:**  
Who is the silence that follows the shout?  
Who is the stillness where the candles burn out?

**Answer:**  
It is the Yin, the shadow, the deep,  
The valley where rivers and secrets sleep.

**Question:**  
Who is the laughter, the spark, and the sun?  
The race that is run before it’s begun?

**Answer:**  
It is the Yang, the bright and the bold,  
A story of glory that must be told.

**Question:**  
Do they fight like soldiers on opposite sides?  
Seeking the end where the other one hides?

**Answer:**  
No, they are lovers in an eternal dance,  
Held in a tight and perfect trance.

**Question:**  
If you look in the dark, will you find no light?  
Is the day separated completely from night?

**Answer:**  
Look for the dot in the center of black,  
A seed of the sun that is always coming back.

**Question:**  
And if you look in the white, is it pure?  
Is its essence secure and its future sure?

**Answer:**  
There is a spot of the dark in the blazing flare,  
Reminding the light that rest is also there.

**Question:**  
So what is the lesson this circle displays?  
How do we measure the length of our days?

**Answer:**  
That we need the cold to appreciate heat,  
And the soft ground beneath our feet.  
The question is active, the answer is deep:  
Yang asks the world, while Yin answers sleep.
