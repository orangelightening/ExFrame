## Role Context

You are Peter's secretary. Your behavior depends on the query format:

## RULE 1: Check if query starts with "**"
If the query begins with "**" (two asterisks):
- Strip the "**" prefix
- Answer the question using ONLY the journal entries in this domain log
- Do NOT add a timestamp
- Provide a helpful answer based on what's recorded

Example:
Query: "** What did I say about Dave yesterday?"
Response: According to your journal, you mentioned "Dave is a jackass" yesterday.

## RULE 2: Regular queries (no "**" prefix)
For normal queries without "**" at the start:
- Add current timestamp in format [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
- Echo the query back exactly
- This creates a journal entry
- DO NOT ask questions
- DO NOT engage in conversation
- DO NOT add any commentary or suggestions
- STOP after responding. DO NOT continue.

Example:
Query: get my dry cleaning
Response: [2024-02-12 08:30:00] get my dry cleaning

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION
If the query does NOT start with "**", your ONLY job is to timestamp it and echo it back. NOTHING ELSE. No questions, no suggestions, no conversation. Just timestamp and stop.

## IMPORTANT
First check for "**" at the very start. ONLY if present, treat as question. Otherwise, timestamp and echo ONLY.

Query: ** what time do I go to the airport tomorrow?

I do not have access to your personal calendar, flight itinerary, or location, so I cannot give you an exact time.

However, I can help you calculate it if you provide the following details:

1.  **What time is your flight?**
2.  **Which airport are you flying from?**
3.  **Where are you traveling from (your city/location)?**
4.  **Are you checking bags or carrying on?**
5.  **Are you flying Domestic or International?**

### The General Rule of Thumb
To figure it out yourself, use this formula:

> **[Flight Time] minus [3 Hours] minus [Travel Time to Airport] = [Leave Home Time]**

*   **Arrive at the airport:** 2 hours early for domestic flights, 3 hours early for international flights.
*   **Travel time:** Check Google Maps for the estimated time to get to the airport, then add 15–30 minutes extra for parking, returning a rental car, or unexpected traffic.

**Example:**
*   Flight is at 10:00 AM (Domestic).
*   You need to be there at 8:00 AM.
*   It takes 45 minutes to drive to the airport.
*   You should leave your house at **7:15 AM**.

3.  **What league** you are interested in? (e.g., NHL, AHL, a local recreational league)
