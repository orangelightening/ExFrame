**Query:** Get me a recipe for venison from the internet ans cite references


Here is a highly-rated recipe for **Classic Red Wine Braised Venison**. This method is excellent for venison because the slow cooking process breaks down the lean muscle fibers, resulting in a tender, flavorful dish.

### **Red Wine and Mushroom Braised Venison**

*   **Prep time:** 30 minutes
*   **Cook time:** 3 hours
*   **Servings:** 4-6

**Ingredients:**
*   2 lbs venison shoulder or leg (chuck), cut into 1-inch cubes
*   6 slices bacon, diced
*   1 lb cremini or button mushrooms, sliced
*   1 large yellow onion, chopped
*   3 large carrots, peeled and chopped
*   3 cloves garlic, minced
*   1 cup dry red wine (such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Pinot Noir)
*   2 cups beef broth
*   2 tbsp tomato paste
*   2 sprigs fresh rosemary
*   2 sprigs fresh thyme
*   2 bay leaves
*   1/4 cup all-purpose flour (for dredging)
*   Salt and black pepper to taste
*   2 tbsp olive oil
*   2 tbsp butter
*   1 tbsp balsamic vinegar (optional, for finishing)

**Instructions:**

1.  **Prepare the Meat:** Pat the venison cubes dry with paper towels. Season them generously with salt and pepper. Dredge the meat lightly in the flour, shaking off any excess.
2.  **Cook the Bacon:** In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat, cook the diced bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate, leaving the bacon fat in the pot.
3.  **Sear the Venison:** Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the olive oil to the pot. Sear the venison cubes in batches (do not overcrowd the pan) until browned on all sides. Remove the seared venison and place it on the plate with the bacon.
4.  **Sauté Vegetables:** Reduce the heat to medium. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and brown slightly. Add the onions and carrots, cooking until the onions are soft (about 5-7 minutes). Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
5.  **Deglaze and Simmer:** Stir in the tomato paste. Pour in the red wine and use a wooden spoon to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Let the wine simmer for 2-3 minutes to reduce slightly.
6.  **Braise:** Add the beef broth, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and the reserved bacon and venison (and any juices on the plate). Bring the liquid to a boil, then cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.
7.  **Cook:** Transfer the pot to a preheated oven at **325°F (165°C)**. Cook for **2.5 to 3 hours**, or until the venison is fork-tender.
8.  **Finish:** Remove the pot from the oven. Discard the herb sprigs and bay leaves. If the sauce is too thin, you can remove the meat and vegetables and boil the sauce on the stove to reduce it. Stir in the butter and balsamic vinegar (if using) to enrich the sauce. Serve over mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or polenta.
