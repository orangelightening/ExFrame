**Query:** Get me a recipe for venison from the internet ans cite references


Here is a highly-rated recipe for **Classic Red Wine Braised Venison**. This method is excellent for venison because the slow cooking process breaks down the lean muscle fibers, resulting in a tender, flavorful dish.

### **Red Wine and Mushroom Braised Venison**

*   **Prep time:** 30 minutes
*   **Cook time:** 3 hours
*   **Servings:** 4-6

**Ingredients:**
*   2 lbs venison shoulder or leg (chuck), cut into 1-inch cubes
*   6 slices bacon, diced
*   1 lb cremini or button mushrooms, sliced
*   1 large yellow onion, chopped
*   3 large carrots, peeled and chopped
*   3 cloves garlic, minced
*   1 cup dry red wine (such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Pinot Noir)
*   2 cups beef broth
*   2 tbsp tomato paste
*   2 sprigs fresh rosemary
*   2 sprigs fresh thyme
*   2 bay leaves
*   1/4 cup all-purpose flour (for dredging)
*   Salt and black pepper to taste
*   2 tbsp olive oil
*   2 tbsp butter
*   1 tbsp balsamic vinegar (optional, for finishing)

**Instructions:**

1.  **Prepare the Meat:** Pat the venison cubes dry with paper towels. Season them generously with salt and pepper. Dredge the meat lightly in the flour, shaking off any excess.
2.  **Cook the Bacon:** In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat, cook the diced bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate, leaving the bacon fat in the pot.
3.  **Sear the Venison:** Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the olive oil to the pot. Sear the venison cubes in batches (do not overcrowd the pan) until browned on all sides. Remove the seared venison and place it on the plate with the bacon.
4.  **Sauté Vegetables:** Reduce the heat to medium. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and brown slightly. Add the onions and carrots, cooking until the onions are soft (about 5-7 minutes). Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
5.  **Deglaze and Simmer:** Stir in the tomato paste. Pour in the red wine and use a wooden spoon to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Let the wine simmer for 2-3 minutes to reduce slightly.
6.  **Braise:** Add the beef broth, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and the reserved bacon and venison (and any juices on the plate). Bring the liquid to a boil, then cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.
7.  **Cook:** Transfer the pot to a preheated oven at **325°F (165°C)**. Cook for **2.5 to 3 hours**, or until the venison is fork-tender.
8.  **Finish:** Remove the pot from the oven. Discard the herb sprigs and bay leaves. If the sauce is too thin, you can remove the meat and vegetables and boil the sauce on the stove to reduce it. Stir in the butter and balsamic vinegar (if using) to enrich the sauce. Serve over mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or polenta.

**Query:** // A recipe for chicken shwarma. citations please.

Based on the search results, here is a comprehensive recipe for Chicken Shawarma that combines the best techniques and spice blends from top-rated food blogs.

### **Chicken Shawarma**

**Description:**
Chicken Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern street food traditionally made on a vertical rotisserie. This home version captures the bold, exotic flavors using chicken thighs marinated in a blend of warm spices, lemon, and garlic. It can be cooked on the stovetop or in the oven for juicy, flavorful results [1][2][3].

---

### **Ingredients**

**The Chicken & Marinade:**
*   **Chicken:** 2 lbs (1 kg) boneless, skinless chicken thighs (thighs are preferred over breasts for tenderness and flavor) [1][2][3].
*   **Oil:** ¼ cup olive oil (or avocado oil) [2][3].
*   **Acid:** ¼ cup lemon juice (freshly squeezed) [2][3].
*   **Garlic:** 4–5 cloves, minced [1][2].

**The Shawarma Spice Blend:**
*   **Cumin:** 2 tsp [3][4].
*   **Paprika:** 2 tsp [1][3].
*   **Coriander:** 1 tsp [3].
*   **Turmeric:** ½ tsp [3][4].
*   **Cayenne Pepper:** ¼ tsp (adjust for heat) [3].
*   **Cinnamon:** ½ tsp [1][4].
*   **Salt & Black Pepper:** 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper (or to taste) [1][2].

*(Optional additions found in various authentic blends include Cardamom, Nutmeg, or Allspice [1][2]).*

**For Serving:**
*   Pita bread or wraps [3].
*   Tahini sauce or Garlic sauce (white sauce) [2][3].
*   Pickles, sliced tomatoes, and sliced cucumbers [2][3].
*   Thinly sliced red onions (tossed in sumac is traditional) [3].

---

### **Instructions**

**Step 1: Create the Marinade**
In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and all of the spices (cumin, paprika, coriander, turmeric, cayenne, cinnamon, salt, and pepper) until well combined [2][3].

**Step 2: Marinate the Chicken**
Add the chicken thighs to the bowl and toss them thoroughly to ensure every piece is coated in the marinade.
*   *Note:* For the best flavor, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably 3 to 4 hours. You can also marinate overnight [2][3].

**Step 3: Choose Your Cooking Method**

*   **Stovetop Method (High Heat/Sear):**
    1.  Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large cast-iron skillet or heavy pan over medium-high heat.
    2.  Add the chicken in a single layer (do this in batches if necessary so you don't steam the meat).
    3.  Cook for about 4–5 minutes on each side until golden brown and charred, and the chicken is cooked through (internal temp of 165°F/74°C) [2].

*   **Oven Method (Sheet Pan):**
    1.  Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
    2.  Place the marinated chicken pieces on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread them out evenly.
    3.  Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the edges are crispy [3].

**Step 4: Rest and Slice**
Remove the chicken from the heat and let it rest for 5–10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute. Slice the chicken into thin strips [2].

**Step 5: Serve**
Warm your pita bread and stuff it with the sliced chicken. Top with tahini sauce, garlic sauce, pickles, and fresh vegetables [2][3].

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Marinade:**
   - In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and all the spices [1][2][3].

2. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - Add the chicken thighs to the bowl and toss to coat thoroughly with the marinade [1][2].
   - Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably 3-4 hours for maximum flavor [1][3]. Some recipes suggest marinating overnight [2].

   **Oven Method:**
   - Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C) [1].
   - Place chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper [1].

- Don't skip the marinating time – it's essential for authentic flavor [1][2].

- Searing the chicken after cooking (if using the oven method) adds those characteristic crispy edges [1].

## Variations

- Add a tablespoon of tomato paste to the marinade for a deeper color and flavor [2].
- Include ½ teaspoon of allspice in the spice blend for a more traditional flavor profile [2].
- Serve over rice with hummus and tabbouleh for a shawarma bowl instead of a wrap [2].

Query: What is the weather in Nanaimo. Citations. do not use stale data


Based on my search of the latest online sources, here is the step-by-step reasoning regarding the current weather in Nanaimo:

1.  **Identified Current Conditions:** I checked **The Weather Network**, which provides a specific "Current Weather" snapshot updated recently. According to this source, the temperature is **4°C** with **partly cloudy** skies. It notes that it feels like **0°C**. The reported high for the day is 9°C and the low is 4°C [1].
2.  **Analyzed Hourly Forecast:** I consulted **Environment Canada** for the official government forecast. Their data, last updated at 6:17 PM local time, indicates a trend of clearing skies. Earlier in the day, there was a 40% chance of showers, but the forecast shows conditions shifting to "mainly sunny" by late afternoon and becoming "clear" overnight as temperatures drop to between 1°C and 4°C [2].
3.  **Cross-Referenced Daily Summary:** **EasyWeather** provides a daily summary aligning with these conditions, noting a high of 11°C and a low of 1°C. They indicated a high probability of rain earlier in the day (88%), which aligns with the Environment Canada observation of a chance of showers in the morning/early afternoon [3].

**Final Answer:**
Currently, the weather in Nanaimo is **4°C** with **partly cloudy** skies, though it feels closer to **0°C**. Conditions are expected to clear up this evening, becoming sunny and eventually clear overnight as temperatures drop to around **1-2°C**.

Query: How do I bake chicken breast?

Here is the step-by-step reasoning on how to bake chicken breast based on current culinary best practices:

1.  **Determine the optimal temperature**: Most modern recipes suggest baking at **400°F (200°C)** or **375°F (190°C)**. A higher temperature (400°F) helps sear the outside slightly and cooks the chicken faster, reducing the time it has to dry out in the oven.
2.  **Prepare the chicken**: To ensure even cooking, the chicken breasts should be of uniform thickness. If they are very thick, pounding them with a meat mallet is recommended. They should also be patted dry with paper towels to help the skin or seasoning crisp up rather than steam.
3.  **Seasoning**: Rub the chicken with a small amount of oil (olive oil or melted butter) to help the seasonings stick and keep the meat moist. Season generously with salt, pepper, and optional herbs (like garlic powder, paprika, or thyme).
4.  **Baking time and process**: Place the chicken in a single layer in a baking dish or on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake at 400°F for approximately **18 to 25 minutes**, depending on the thickness of the meat.
5.  **Check for doneness**: The most reliable way to check is using a meat thermometer. The USDA recommends an internal temperature of **165°F (74°C)**. However, many chefs suggest removing it at **160°F (71°C)** and letting it rest, as the temperature will rise to 165°F while resting.
6.  **Resting the meat**: Let the chicken rest for 5 to 10 minutes after removing it from the oven. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, preventing them from running out onto the cutting board and keeping the chicken tender.

***

### Final Answer: How to Bake Chicken Breast

**Ingredients:**
*   Boneless, skinless chicken breasts
*   Olive oil or melted butter
*   Salt and black pepper
*   Optional seasonings: Garlic powder, paprika, dried herbs (oregano, thyme), or Italian seasoning.

**Equipment:**
*   Baking dish or rimmed baking sheet
*   Meat thermometer (highly recommended)
*   Small bowl
*   Paper towels

**Instructions:**

1.  **Preheat the oven**: Set your oven to **400°F (200°C)**. Allow it to fully preheat while you prep the chicken.
2.  **Prep the chicken**: Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. If the breasts are very thick (uneven), place them in a zip-lock bag or between plastic wrap and gently pound them with a meat mallet or rolling pin until they are an even thickness (about ¾ to 1 inch thick).
3.  **Season**: Rub the chicken breasts generously with olive oil. In a small bowl, mix your salt, pepper, and any other dried spices you prefer. Sprinkle the seasoning mix over the chicken, pressing it into the meat so it adheres well.
4.  **Arrange for baking**: Place the seasoned chicken breasts in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or in a greased baking dish. Ensure there is a little space between each piece for heat circulation.
5.  **Bake**: Place the chicken in the oven and bake for **18 to 25 minutes**. Start checking at the 18-minute mark.
6.  **Check doneness**: Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast.
    *   **USDA Safe:** 165°F (74°C)
    *   **Chef's Tip:** Remove at 160°F (71°C) and let it rest (it will continue cooking to 165°F).
7.  **Rest**: Remove the chicken from the oven and tent it loosely with aluminum foil. Let it rest on the counter for **5 to 10 minutes** before slicing or serving. This step is crucial for juicy meat.

Query: What is a great recipe for duck a l'orange

Based on the search results, a highly rated and approachable recipe comes from **Chef John on AllRecipes**. This version is particularly "great" because it uses **duck breasts** instead of a whole duck. This significantly reduces the cooking time (to about 20 minutes) and makes it much easier to achieve crispy skin without drying out the meat, while still delivering that classic rich, sweet, and tangy orange sauce.

Here is a step-by-step guide for **Classic Duck à l'Orange**.

### **The Secret to Success**
The key to this dish is **rendering the fat**. Duck breasts are covered in a thick layer of fat. By cooking them slowly skin-side down, you melt that fat away (save it for roast potatoes later!) leaving behind incredibly crispy skin.

---

### **Ingredients**

**The Duck:**
*   **2 Duck breast halves** (boneless, skin-on)
*   **Kosher salt** (generous amount)
*   **Black pepper**

**The Orange Sauce:**
*   **1/2 cup Chicken broth** (low sodium is best so you can control the salt)
*   **2 tbsp Orange liqueur** (such as Grand Marnier or Cointreau)
*   **1 tbsp Sherry vinegar** (or red wine vinegar)
*   **2 tbsp Orange marmalade** (Seville or bitter orange marmalade is traditional for authenticity)
*   **1 tsp Grated orange zest**
*   **Pinch of Cayenne pepper** (adds a subtle warmth)

---

### **Instructions**

#### **1. Prepare the Duck**
Remove the duck breasts from the fridge about 20 minutes before cooking to let them come to room temperature. Using a sharp knife, score the skin in a crosshatch or diamond pattern. Be careful not to cut through the meat into the flesh. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.

#### **2. Render the Skin (The Most Important Step)**
Place the duck breasts **skin-side down** in a large cold skillet (cast iron or stainless steel works best). Turn the heat to **medium-low**.

*   **Why cold?** Starting in a cold pan allows the fat to render out slowly. If you start with a hot pan, the skin will burn before the fat melts.
*   Cook for about **10–12 minutes**. You will hear the fat sizzling and popping. As the fat melts, pour it into a heat-safe container (don't pour it down the drain!).
*   The skin is ready when it is golden brown and crispy.

#### **3. Cook the Meat**
Once the skin is crispy, flip the breasts. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook the flesh side for about **3–5 minutes**.

*   **Doneness:** Duck is best served medium-rare to medium. Use an instant-read thermometer; aim for an internal temperature of **130°F – 135°F (54°C – 57°C)**.
*   Remove the duck from the pan and place it on a cutting board skin-side up. Tent loosely with foil to rest while you make the sauce.

#### **4. Make the Orange Sauce**
Pour out all but about 1 tablespoon of the remaining duck fat from the skillet. Place the skillet back over medium heat.

*   Add the **chicken broth**, **orange liqueur**, **vinegar**, **orange marmalade**, **orange zest**, and **cayenne pepper**.
*   Whisk everything together, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
*   Simmer the sauce for about 3–5 minutes until it reduces slightly and thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.

#### **5. Serve**
Slice the rested duck breasts thinly. Arrange the slices on a plate and spoon the warm orange sauce over the top. Garnish with fresh orange segments or parsley if desired.

---

### **Chef’s Tips**
*   **Crispy Skin:** If your skin isn't as crispy as you'd like after rendering, you can place the duck under a broiler for 30–60 seconds after the initial sear (watch it closely so it doesn't burn).
*   **The Sauce Balance:** The marmalade provides body and bitterness, the fresh zest provides aromatic oils, and the vinegar cuts through the sweetness. If your sauce is too sweet, add a splash more vinegar.
*   **Sides:** This pairs perfectly with fluffy mashed potatoes, wild rice, or green beans almondine.

---

### **Equipment Needed**
*   Roasting pan with rack
*   Meat thermometer
*   Chef’s knife or poultry shears
*   Fine-mesh strainer or chinois
*   Saucepan (medium and heavy-bottomed)
*   Blender or immersion blender (optional)
*   Large stockpot (if making homemade stock)

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

#### **1. Prepare and Dry-Brine the Duck**
Trim excess fat and remove giblets from the duck cavity. Pat the skin thoroughly dry with paper towels. Prick the skin all over with a fork (be careful not to pierce the meat). Generously salt the skin and cavity. Place the duck on a rack in the refrigerator, uncovered, for **24 hours**. This dry-brining process is crucial for crispy skin.

#### **2. Make Duck Stock (Optional but Recommended)**
While the duck brines, you can make a flavorful stock. In a large pot, combine the duck neck, wings, onion, carrots, celery, leek, garlic, star anise, and peppercorns. Cover with water, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for **3–4 hours**. Strain the liquid and reserve 2 cups (480 ml) for the sauce.

#### **3. Blanch the Orange Zest**
Peel the zest from 2 oranges, trying to avoid the white pith. Cut the peel into thin strips. Place the strips in boiling water with **1½ tablespoons of baking soda** and boil for **15 minutes**. This step removes the bitterness from the peel. Drain and set aside.

#### **4. Preheat and Prep Duck**
Preheat your oven to **450°F (230°C)**. Remove the duck from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for **30 minutes**.
*   *Pro Tip:* Place the duck on a rack in the sink and carefully pour boiling water over the skin. This tightens the skin, ensuring extra crispiness.

#### **5. Initial Roasting**
Place the duck breast-side down on a rack in a roasting pan. Add 1 cup of water to the bottom of the pan to prevent smoking. Roast at **450°F (230°C)** for **20 minutes**.

#### **6. Reduce Heat and Flip**
Reduce the oven temperature to **350°F (175°C)**. Flip the duck so it is breast-side up. Roast for **30 minutes**.

#### **7. Continue Roasting**
Flip the duck back to breast-side down and roast for another **30 minutes**.
*   *Note:* Flipping the duck helps render the fat evenly.

#### **8. Final Roast and Crisp**
Flip the duck one last time so it is breast-side up. Roast for another **40 minutes**.
Increase the oven temperature back to **450°F (230°C)**. Roast for **10–15 minutes** until the skin is deep golden and crisp. The internal temperature should reach **170°F (77°C)** in the thigh.

#### **9. Rest the Duck**
Transfer the duck to a cutting board and tent loosely with foil. Let it rest for **15 minutes** before carving.

#### **10. Make the Orange Sauce**
In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the **sugar** and **red wine vinegar**. Cook over medium heat, undisturbed, until the sugar melts and turns a deep amber color (approx. 3–5 minutes).
*   *Caution:* Carefully add the **orange juice** (it will bubble violently). Then add the **duck stock**, **honey**, **soy sauce**, and **blanched orange zest**. Simmer for **10 minutes**.

#### **11. Finish the Sauce**
Stir in the **Cointreau or Grand Marnier**.
*   *Optional Thickening:* If you want a thicker sauce, mix 1 tablespoon of flour with 1 tablespoon of butter to make a paste (beurre manié). Whisk this into the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.
*   Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve for a smooth texture. Skim any excess fat from the pan juices and stir them into the sauce. Adjust seasoning if needed.

#### **12. Carve and Serve**
Cut the duck into quarters (breasts and legs). Serve with the warm orange sauce, garnished with extra orange segments if desired. This pairs excellently with roasted potatoes, rice, or green beans.

---

### **Pro Tips for Success**
*   **Crispy Skin:** The combination of dry-brining (24 hours in the fridge) and pouring boiling water over the bird before roasting is the secret to restaurant-quality crackling skin.
*   **Sauce Balance:** If the sauce tastes too bitter, add a touch more honey. If it is too sweet, balance it with a splash of vinegar.
*   **Dietary:** To make this dish gluten-free, omit the flour thickener. To make it dairy-free, omit the butter.

### **Storage**
*   **Refrigerate:** Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
*   **Freeze:** Both the sauce and the cooked duck can be frozen for up to 3 months. Reheat gently to prevent the sauce from separating.

Query: A great recipe for duck a l'orange



Based on the available information, I have compared the recipe provided in the context with the results found via web search.

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Context Recipe Analysis:** The context recipe offers a "classic French" approach. It utilizes a high-heat start (475°F) to render fat and crisp the skin, followed by a lower roast. The sauce involves creating a caramel base, adding white wine, stock, and orange liqueur (Cointreau/Grand Marnier). This aligns with the traditional, refined culinary definition of Duck à l'Orange.
2.  **Web Search Analysis:** The web search result provided a "Roast Stuffed Duck" recipe. While it includes an orange glaze, it also includes stuffing made with green peppers and crushed seasoned stuffing mix. The cooking method uses a steady 350°F and the sauce is a simple cornstarch-thickened glaze without wine or liqueur. This is a more home-style, Americanized variation rather than the classic French dish.
3.  **Comparison:** For a request specifically for "Duck à l'Orange," the context recipe is superior because it focuses on the essential elements of the dish: crispy skin and a complex, glossy sauce derived from caramelized sugar and spirits.
4.  **Conclusion:** I will present the Context recipe as the best choice for a "great" Duck à l'Orange, as it delivers the restaurant-quality results and traditional flavor profile expected of this dish.

*   **Dry White Wine**: ½ cup (120 ml)
*   **White Wine Vinegar**: 2 tbsp (for caramel)
*   **Duck or Chicken Stock**: 2 cups (480 ml)
*   **Cointreau or Grand Marnier**: ½ cup (120 ml)
*   **Cornstarch or Arrowroot**: 2–3 tbsp (16–24 g), mixed with 3 tbsp cold water (or flour-butter paste)

### Equipment Needed
*   Roasting pan with rack
*   Instant-read thermometer
*   Fine-mesh sieve or chinois
*   Small and medium heavy saucepans
*   Vegetable peeler
*   Sharp knife and poultry shears
*   Basting brush

### Instructions

**1. Prepare the Duck**
Preheat oven to 475°F (245°C). In a small bowl, mix salt, pepper, coriander, and cumin. Pat the duck thoroughly dry. Season inside and out with the spice blend. Cut one orange in half; quarter one half and stuff into the cavity with 4 onion wedges, thyme, marjoram, and parsley. Squeeze juice from the other half into a bowl and set aside.

**2. Roast Initially**
Place carrot, celery, and remaining onion wedges in the roasting pan. Set the duck breast-side up on the rack. Roast for 30 minutes at 475°F to render fat and begin crisping the skin.

**3. Reduce Heat and Baste**
Lower oven temperature to 350°F (175°C). Pour the reserved orange juice, white wine, and ½ cup stock into the pan. Return to oven and roast for 1–1¼ hours, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh reads 170°F (77°C).

**4. Caramelize Sugar for Sauce**
While the duck roasts, heat ⅓ cup sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook undisturbed until it begins to melt, then stir until fully melted and deep golden. Carefully add ⅓ cup fresh orange juice and 2 tbsp white wine vinegar (mixture will bubble vigorously). Stir in zest from ½ orange and a pinch of salt. Simmer until smooth; set aside.

**5. Finish the Duck**
Remove duck from oven. Optionally broil for 2–3 minutes to deepen skin color. Transfer to a cutting board, tent loosely with foil, and rest for 15 minutes. Tilt duck to drain cavity juices into the roasting pan.

**6. Make the Sauce**
Strain pan juices into a measuring cup; skim off fat (reserve fat for roasting potatoes). You should have about 1 cup of liquid; add stock if needed. In a saucepan, bring pan juices to a simmer. Whisk in the cornstarch slurry (or flour-butter paste), then add the caramel-orange mixture. Stir in Cointreau and simmer for 5 minutes until glossy and slightly thickened. Adjust seasoning with salt or pepper.

**7. Carve and Serve**
Remove the backbone and carve the duck into breast and leg quarters. Serve each portion with the warm sauce, roasted vegetables from the pan, and fresh orange segments.

### Pro Tips for Success
*   **Ultra-Crisp Skin:** For the best skin texture, pour boiling water over the duck before seasoning/roasting, then air-dry it in the fridge for 1–2 hours.
*   **Duck Fat:** Do not discard the fat rendered in the pan; it is liquid gold for roasting potatoes or sautéing vegetables.
*   **Sauce Balance:** Use fresh-squeezed orange juice rather than bottled for the brightest, most authentic flavor.

### Substitutions
*   **Liqueur:** Triple sec works, or omit the alcohol for a non-alcoholic version.
*   **Stock:** High-quality chicken stock is a fine substitute if duck stock is unavailable.
*   **Thickener:** Arrowroot or cornstarch keeps the dish gluten-free; flour-butter paste (beurre manié) provides a classic velvety texture.

### **Instructions**

#### **1. Prepare the Ducks**
Preheat your oven to **450°F (232°C)**. Cut off the first two wing joints and chop the necks into 2-inch pieces. Reserve these parts (necks, wing joints, gizzards, hearts) for making the stock.
Using a paring knife, prick the skin of the ducks (breasts, thighs, back) every ½ inch; this helps the fat render out during cooking. Pat the ducks dry thoroughly. Season the skin and cavities generously with **2 tablespoons of salt** and **black pepper**.

#### **2. Initial Roast**
Place a roasting rack inside a large roasting pan and add **1 cup of water** to the bottom. Arrange the ducks breast-side up on the rack, ensuring they are spaced apart. Roast for **20 minutes**.
Remove the pan from the oven, reduce the temperature to **350°F (177°C)**, and turn the ducks onto their sides. Prop them up with large foil balls to keep them stable. Roast for **30 minutes**, then flip to the other side and roast for another **30 minutes**.

#### **3. Make the Duck Stock**
While the ducks are roasting, heat **vegetable oil** in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the reserved duck parts, **¼ teaspoon salt**, and **¼ teaspoon pepper**. Brown for about **10 minutes**.
Add the carrots, tomatoes, leek, onion, celery, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme. Cook until vegetables are softened, about **5 minutes**. Stir in the **flour** and **tomato paste**; cook for 1 minute.
Gradually whisk in the **chicken stock** and **white wine**. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for **1 to 1.25 hours** until thickened. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to extract liquid. You should have about **1 cup of stock**. Discard the solids and wash the saucepan.

#### **4. Prepare the Orange Garnish**
Use a vegetable peeler to remove the zest (peel) from 1 orange in long strips. Cut the strips into thin matchsticks (approx. ¼ cup). Blanch them in boiling water for 1 minute, then drain, rinse under cold water, and pat dry. Set aside.
Segment the remaining 3 oranges: Trim the ends, cut away the peel and pith, and slice between the membranes to release the segments. Set aside.

#### **5. Finish Roasting the Duck**
After the ducks have roasted for a total of 1 hour 20 minutes (initial roast + side roasts), remove the foil balls and turn the ducks breast-side up. Roast until the thighs register an internal temperature of **165°F (74°C)**, which should take another **20–35 minutes**.
Turn the oven to **Broil**. Broil the ducks for **3–5 minutes**, rotating the pan as needed, until the skin is evenly crisp and golden.

#### **6. Collect Drippings**
Transfer the ducks to a cutting board to rest. Insert a wooden spoon into the cavity of each duck and tilt to drain the juices into the roasting pan. Pour the pan juices into a fat separator or measuring cup. Reserve about **1 cup of drippings**, skimming off excess fat.

#### **7. Make the Sauce**
In the clean saucepan, bring the **cider vinegar** and **sugar** to a boil over medium heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then cook undisturbed until the mixture turns a pale caramel color (approx. **4 minutes**).
Gradually stir in the **fresh orange juice**, **currant jelly**, and the **reserved duck stock**. Simmer for **8 minutes** until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
Remove from heat. Stir in the **Grand Marnier**. Whisk in the **butter**, one tablespoon at a time, to enrich the sauce. Stir in the reserved **drippings**. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

#### **8. Serve**
Carve the ducks into serving portions. Arrange them on a platter with the fresh **orange segments**. Sprinkle with the **blanched orange peel** matchsticks. Serve warm with the sauce on the side.
