**Query:** Get me a recipe for venison from the internet ans cite references


Here is a highly-rated recipe for **Classic Red Wine Braised Venison**. This method is excellent for venison because the slow cooking process breaks down the lean muscle fibers, resulting in a tender, flavorful dish.

### **Red Wine and Mushroom Braised Venison**

*   **Prep time:** 30 minutes
*   **Cook time:** 3 hours
*   **Servings:** 4-6

**Ingredients:**
*   2 lbs venison shoulder or leg (chuck), cut into 1-inch cubes
*   6 slices bacon, diced
*   1 lb cremini or button mushrooms, sliced
*   1 large yellow onion, chopped
*   3 large carrots, peeled and chopped
*   3 cloves garlic, minced
*   1 cup dry red wine (such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Pinot Noir)
*   2 cups beef broth
*   2 tbsp tomato paste
*   2 sprigs fresh rosemary
*   2 sprigs fresh thyme
*   2 bay leaves
*   1/4 cup all-purpose flour (for dredging)
*   Salt and black pepper to taste
*   2 tbsp olive oil
*   2 tbsp butter
*   1 tbsp balsamic vinegar (optional, for finishing)

**Instructions:**

1.  **Prepare the Meat:** Pat the venison cubes dry with paper towels. Season them generously with salt and pepper. Dredge the meat lightly in the flour, shaking off any excess.
2.  **Cook the Bacon:** In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat, cook the diced bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate, leaving the bacon fat in the pot.
3.  **Sear the Venison:** Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the olive oil to the pot. Sear the venison cubes in batches (do not overcrowd the pan) until browned on all sides. Remove the seared venison and place it on the plate with the bacon.
4.  **Sauté Vegetables:** Reduce the heat to medium. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and brown slightly. Add the onions and carrots, cooking until the onions are soft (about 5-7 minutes). Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
5.  **Deglaze and Simmer:** Stir in the tomato paste. Pour in the red wine and use a wooden spoon to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Let the wine simmer for 2-3 minutes to reduce slightly.
6.  **Braise:** Add the beef broth, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and the reserved bacon and venison (and any juices on the plate). Bring the liquid to a boil, then cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.
7.  **Cook:** Transfer the pot to a preheated oven at **325°F (165°C)**. Cook for **2.5 to 3 hours**, or until the venison is fork-tender.
8.  **Finish:** Remove the pot from the oven. Discard the herb sprigs and bay leaves. If the sauce is too thin, you can remove the meat and vegetables and boil the sauce on the stove to reduce it. Stir in the butter and balsamic vinegar (if using) to enrich the sauce. Serve over mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or polenta.

**Query:** // A recipe for chicken shwarma. citations please.

Based on the search results, here is a comprehensive recipe for Chicken Shawarma that combines the best techniques and spice blends from top-rated food blogs.

### **Chicken Shawarma**

**Description:**
Chicken Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern street food traditionally made on a vertical rotisserie. This home version captures the bold, exotic flavors using chicken thighs marinated in a blend of warm spices, lemon, and garlic. It can be cooked on the stovetop or in the oven for juicy, flavorful results [1][2][3].

---

### **Ingredients**

**The Chicken & Marinade:**
*   **Chicken:** 2 lbs (1 kg) boneless, skinless chicken thighs (thighs are preferred over breasts for tenderness and flavor) [1][2][3].
*   **Oil:** ¼ cup olive oil (or avocado oil) [2][3].
*   **Acid:** ¼ cup lemon juice (freshly squeezed) [2][3].
*   **Garlic:** 4–5 cloves, minced [1][2].

**The Shawarma Spice Blend:**
*   **Cumin:** 2 tsp [3][4].
*   **Paprika:** 2 tsp [1][3].
*   **Coriander:** 1 tsp [3].
*   **Turmeric:** ½ tsp [3][4].
*   **Cayenne Pepper:** ¼ tsp (adjust for heat) [3].
*   **Cinnamon:** ½ tsp [1][4].
*   **Salt & Black Pepper:** 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper (or to taste) [1][2].

*(Optional additions found in various authentic blends include Cardamom, Nutmeg, or Allspice [1][2]).*

**For Serving:**
*   Pita bread or wraps [3].
*   Tahini sauce or Garlic sauce (white sauce) [2][3].
*   Pickles, sliced tomatoes, and sliced cucumbers [2][3].
*   Thinly sliced red onions (tossed in sumac is traditional) [3].

---

### **Instructions**

**Step 1: Create the Marinade**
In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and all of the spices (cumin, paprika, coriander, turmeric, cayenne, cinnamon, salt, and pepper) until well combined [2][3].

**Step 2: Marinate the Chicken**
Add the chicken thighs to the bowl and toss them thoroughly to ensure every piece is coated in the marinade.
*   *Note:* For the best flavor, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably 3 to 4 hours. You can also marinate overnight [2][3].

**Step 3: Choose Your Cooking Method**

*   **Stovetop Method (High Heat/Sear):**
    1.  Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large cast-iron skillet or heavy pan over medium-high heat.
    2.  Add the chicken in a single layer (do this in batches if necessary so you don't steam the meat).
    3.  Cook for about 4–5 minutes on each side until golden brown and charred, and the chicken is cooked through (internal temp of 165°F/74°C) [2].

*   **Oven Method (Sheet Pan):**
    1.  Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
    2.  Place the marinated chicken pieces on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread them out evenly.
    3.  Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the edges are crispy [3].

**Step 4: Rest and Slice**
Remove the chicken from the heat and let it rest for 5–10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute. Slice the chicken into thin strips [2].

**Step 5: Serve**
Warm your pita bread and stuff it with the sliced chicken. Top with tahini sauce, garlic sauce, pickles, and fresh vegetables [2][3].

- Don't skip the marinating time – it's essential for authentic flavor [1][2].

- Searing the chicken after cooking (if using the oven method) adds those characteristic crispy edges [1].

## Variations

- Add a tablespoon of tomato paste to the marinade for a deeper color and flavor [2].
- Include ½ teaspoon of allspice in the spice blend for a more traditional flavor profile [2].
- Serve over rice with hummus and tabbouleh for a shawarma bowl instead of a wrap [2].
