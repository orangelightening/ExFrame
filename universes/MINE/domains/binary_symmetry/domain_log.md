Query: what is binary-symmetry?

The term "binary symmetry" can refer to different concepts depending on the context, but it is most commonly associated with the **Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC)** in information theory.

In the context of the **Binary Symmetric Channel**, binary symmetry refers to the property that the probability of a bit being flipped during transmission is the same regardless of whether the transmitted bit is 0 or 1. Specifically:

- A bit is transmitted as either 0 or 1.
- There is a crossover probability $p that the bit is flipped (i.e., 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0).
- The channel is symmetric because this error probability p is identical for both types of bits.
- The probability of correct reception is 1 - p for both bits.

This symmetry simplifies the analysis of communication systems and is foundational in coding theory and error correction. The BSC model is used to represent noisy communication channels such as satellite links, wireless networks, and data storage systems like disk drives.

Additionally, binary symmetry may be confused with other symmetry concepts, but in technical contexts, it primarily relates to the balanced error behavior in binary communication channels. If the error probabilities were different for 0 and 1, the channel would be considered asymmetric, such as in a Z-channel.

The capacity C of a Binary Symmetric Channel is given by:


C = 1 - H_b(p)


where H_b(p) is the binary entropy function defined as:


H_b(p) = -p \log_2(p) - (1-p) \log_2(1-p)
$

This represents the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over the channel with arbitrarily low error, according to the noisy-channel coding theorem.
