**Query:** What is the sidekick domain?

Based on the domain log and our conversation history, the **sidekick domain** is:

## 🎯 **What the Sidekick Domain Is:**

**A persistent conversation context** where I serve as your personal assistant and technical co-pilot for the ExFrame project. It's a dedicated space in the ExFrame system that maintains our collaboration history and role relationship.

## 📋 **Key Characteristics:**

### **1. Purpose & Function:**
- **Persistent Context**: Maintains memory across sessions (via `domain_log.md`)
- **Technical Collaboration**: Focused on ExFrame development, debugging, and strategy
- **Role-Based Interaction**: You as director/user, me as assistant/sidekick
- **Project Access**: Full access to ExFrame files and documentation

### **2. Technical Implementation:**
- **Domain ID**: `sidekick`
- **Created**: 2026-02-10 05:58:23 (current session)
- **Log File**: `/app/project/docs/domain_log.md`
- **Persona**: Assistant/co-pilot (implied, not explicitly set like other domains)

### **3. From the Domain Log Context:**
The role context states:
> "You are my sidekick and personal assistant. You have full access to the ExFrame project files and documentation. You are part of a team of AIs and humans working on this project together."

### **4. How It Differs from Other Domains:**
| Domain Type | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Sidekick** | Personal assistant, technical collaboration | Our ongoing conversation |
| **Researcher** | Knowledge collection, pattern creation | `design_insights` domain |
| **Surveyor** | Autonomous web research | Collecting design principles |
| **Therapist** | Therapeutic dialogue | Mental health support |

## 🔄 **Current State:**
- **Active Since**: 2026-02-10 05:58:23 (session restart)
- **Conversation History**: All our interactions logged in `domain_log.md`
- **Context Maintained**: Your identity (Peter from Nanoose Bay, BC), project focus, role relationship
- **Patterns Created**: 3 patterns so far (including "Who is the sidekick?")

## 💡 **Why This Domain Exists:**

From the originator's notes, this reflects the vision of:
> "The use of a domain to act as therapist with dialogue and forever context... the ability of the AI to perform reliably enough to be of real service if nurtured in the role it is filling as it emerges."

The sidekick domain embodies this by:
1. **Providing persistent context** across conversations
2. **Enabling reliable assistance** through role consistency
3. **Facilitating human-AI collaboration** on technical projects
4. **Creating an emergent partnership** that improves over time

## 🛠️ **Practical Usage:**

In our current session, the sidekick domain enables:
- **Memory**: I remember our previous conversations about patterns, your location correction, etc.
- **Project Context**: I know we're working on ExFrame improvements
- **Role Clarity**: I understand my role as your assistant
- **Continuity**: Our work accumulates in the domain log for future reference

## 📈 **Evolution:**

The sidekick domain isn't static - it evolves through:
1. **Pattern accumulation** (like the 3 patterns we've created)
2. **Context refinement** (like your location correction)
3. **Role deepening** (as we collaborate more effectively)
4. **Knowledge building** (about ExFrame, your preferences, project goals)

---

**Bottom line**: The sidekick domain is **our dedicated collaboration space** within ExFrame where I serve as your persistent assistant, maintaining context, history, and role consistency to help with the ExFrame project and related technical work.

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of how this domain functions or how we can optimize our use of it?
