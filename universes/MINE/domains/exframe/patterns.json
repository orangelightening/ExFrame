    "solution": "# **The Odyssey of ExFrame: A Persona's Journey**\n\n## **I. The Call to Query**\n\n*Hark! From the mortal realm a question springs,  \nA digital plea on silicon wings.  \nTo ExFrame's gates the query flies,  \nBeneath the vast and data-filled skies.*\n\n**The FastAPI Oracle** receives the plea,  \nAnd summons forth the trinity:  \nThree personas, each with sacred art,  \nTo play their destined, separate part.\n\n---\n\n## **II. The Pattern Override - First Trial**\n\n*Before the persona's path is trod,  \nThe system seeks the local god.  \nIn patterns.json, a treasure trove,  \nOf curated wisdom from above.*\n\n**The Decision Tree** with branches two:  \nIf patterns match, the old paths true.  \nIf none are found, the persona's way,  \nShall guide the query through the day.\n\n---\n\n## **III. The Poet's Journey (Void Persona)**\n\n*Behold the Poet, pure of mind,  \nNo earthly sources need he find.  \nFrom void he draws with artful hand,  \nCreative visions from no land.*\n\n**His Odyssey:**\n```\nQuery \u2192 Pure Generation \u2192 Response\n    \u2193\nNo footprints in the sand\nNo sources to demand\nOnly the Muse's gentle hand\n```\n\n*With temperature at eight-tenths high,  \nHe paints his verses 'neath the sky.  \nNo documents his thoughts confine,  \nHis inspiration is divine.*\n\n**The Poet's Return:**\n*\"I traveled inward, deep and far,  \nNo need for book or distant star.  \nFrom silence came the words you see,  \nA gift of pure creativity.\"*\n\n---\n\n## **IV. The Librarian's Quest (Library Persona)**\n\n*The Librarian, with patient grace,  \nSeeks wisdom in a bounded space.  \nThrough document halls he makes his way,  \nWhere curated knowledge lay.*\n\n**His Odyssey:**\n```\nQuery \u2192 Semantic Search \u2192 Document Load\n    \u2193\nThrough embeddings' cosmic sea\nHe sails with purpose, wild and free\nTen documents his ship will hold\nTheir wisdom in his mind enfold\n```\n\n*With cosine similarity his guide,  \nThrough vector space he'll gently glide.  \nFrom doc_embeddings.json he reads,  \nThe most relevant of all the seeds.*\n\n**The Librarian's Return:**\n*\"I searched the archives, deep and wide,  \nWhere countless documents reside.  \nFrom ten I drew the truest lore,  \nTo answer what you're searching for.\"*\n\n---\n\n## **V. The Researcher's Voyage (Internet Persona)**\n\n*The Researcher, bold and unconfined,  \nSeeks knowledge of the human kind.  \nAcross the web's vast, rolling sea,  \nHe hunts for truth and clarity.*\n\n**His Odyssey:**\n```\nQuery \u2192 Web Search \u2192 Parse Results\n    \u2193\nOn DuckDuckGo's mighty wings\nHe soars where current knowledge sings\nParsing title, snippet, URL\nThe modern world's compelling tale\n```\n\n*Through search results he picks his course,  \nFrom many streams he draws the source.  \nEach URL a port of call,  \nWhere information stands tall.*\n\n**The Researcher's Return:**\n*\"I sailed the internet's great deep,  \nWhere modern truths their vigil keep.  \nFrom living sources, fresh and new,  \nI bring perspectives back to you.\"*\n\n---\n\n## **VI. The Enricher's Forge**\n\n*Now all personas, homeward bound,  \nTo Enricher's forge are gathered 'round.  \nWhere raw results are shaped and wrought,  \nTo final form and purpose brought.*\n\n**First, ReplyFormation** with skillful art,  \nPrepares each source to play its part.  \nWith URLs displayed so clear,  \nThat all the provenance appears.\n\n**Then LLMEnricher** takes the stage,  \nTo synthesize from every page.  \nFrom web or local, void or text,  \nThe finest answer is complexed.\n\n---\n\n## **VII. The Homecoming**\n\n*Thus ends each persona's separate quest,  \nReturning with their very best.  \nTo user waiting, patient, true,  \nThe system's work comes into view.*\n\n**The Pattern Override's Wisdom:**\n*\"First seek the local, tried and true,  \nThen persona's path pursue.  \nThis simple choice, this binary test,  \nMakes ExFrame's architecture blessed.\"*\n\n**The Moral of the Odyssey:**\n*Three paths diverge from query's spring,  \nEach with the gifts they choose to bring.  \nThe Poet's art from void ascends,  \nThe Librarian on documents depends,  \nThe Researcher where the web extends.  \nYet all return to where they start,  \nWith wisdom for the questioning heart.*\n\n---\n\n## **Epilogue: The Architect's Design**\n\n*So sings the tale of Phase One's grace,  \nWhere three personas take their place.  \nReplacing types of fivefold art,  \nWith cleaner code and simpler heart.*\n\n*From thousand lines to one decision,  \nA visionary, clear precision.  \nPatterns first, then persona's way,  \nGuides every query night and day.*\n\n*Thus ExFrame's odyssey is told,  \nIn architecture brave and bold.  \nWhere every question finds its guide,  \nWith persona as its faithful tide.*",
