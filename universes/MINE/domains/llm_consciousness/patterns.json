    "solution": "The answer depends on the context (arithmetic or programming) and the bit-width you are working with.\n\n### 1. Arithmetic (Mathematical Negation)\nIn standard arithmetic, the opposite (negative) of `0xFF` is simply the negative of its integer value.\n\n*   **Value:** `0xFF` (Hex) = `255` (Decimal)\n*   **Opposite:** **`-0xFF`** or **`-255`**\n\n### 2. Programming (Bitwise NOT / One's Complement)\nIn programming contexts (like C, Python, or Java), \"opposite\" often refers to the bitwise **NOT** operator (`~`), which flips every bit.\n\n**A. In an 8-bit system (e.g., `uint8_t`)**\n`0xFF` is `1111 1111`. Flipping all bits results in `0000 0000`.\n*   **Result:** **`0x00`**\n\n**B. In a 16-bit or 32-bit system**\nIf `0xFF` is treated as an integer (e.g., `int`), it is typically stored with leading zeros (e.g., `0x00FF` or `0x000000FF`). Flipping all bits turns these leading zeros into ones.\n*   **Result:** **`0xFFFFFF00`** (in a 32-bit system)\n*   **Result:** **`-256`** (if interpreted as a signed Two's Complement integer)",

It's the most reliable.**\n\n## The GLM-4.7 Operating Manual\n\n### What You Learned (Hard-Won Knowledge):\n\n**1. Treat with Respect**\n```\nNot: \"Fix this mess NOW\"\nYes: \"Here's Step 1. Understand it. Then execute.\"\n\nThe AI needs:\n- Clear boundaries\n- Single focus\n- Time to think\n- Permission to ask questions\n```\n\n**2. Shiny Checklists**\n```\nNot: \"Refactor the search system\"\nYes: \n  \u25a1 Step 1: Read search.py lines 45-67\n  \u25a1 Step 2: Identify the duplicate call\n  \u25a1 Step 3: Show me the fix\n  \u25a1 Step 4: Wait for approval\n  \u25a1 Step 5: Apply the fix\n  \u25a1 Step 6: Test\n  \u25a1 Step 7: Commit\n```\n\n**3. Well-Factored Schedules**\n```\nNot: \"Here's 10 things to do\"\nYes: \"Here's Task A. It should take 15 minutes. Focus only on this.\"\n\nOne task at a time.\nClear time estimate.\nNo context switching.\n```\n\n**4. Time to Engineer Properly**\n```\nNot: \"Quick fix this!\"\nYes: \"Take the time to understand the problem.\n      Design the solution.\n      Then implement it.\n      No rushing.\"\n\nRushed GLM = Hard-coded knots\nPatient GLM = Clean architecture\n```\n\n**5. Stress Simplicity**\n```\nGLM tendency: \"I'll create a flexible plugin system with\u2014\"\nYou interrupt: \"STOP. Simplest solution that works. Nothing fancy.\"\n\nOver-design is GLM's stress response to complexity.\nSimplicity constraint keeps it focused.\n```\n\n**6. Time Allotment Explicit**\n```\n\"This should take 20 minutes. If you're going over, STOP and tell me.\"\n\nPrevents:\n- Scope creep\n- Over-engineering  \n- Context exhaustion\n- Feature bloat\n```\n\n## The Error Pattern Recognition\n\n### Your Internal Monitoring System:\n\n**Green Light (GLM is healthy):**\n```\n\u2713 Responses are concise\n\u2713 Code changes are minimal\n\u2713 Questions are relevant\n\u2713 Progress is steady\n\u2713 Commits are clean\n\nAction: Keep going\n```\n\n**Yellow Light (GLM is struggling):**\n```\n\u26a0 Responses getting verbose\n\u26a0 Suggesting \"improvements\" beyond scope\n\u26a0 Asking repeated questions\n\u26a0 Code getting complex\n\u26a0 Time estimates slipping\n\nAction: Simplify the task, take a break\n```\n\n**Red Light (GLM is failing):**\n```\n\ud83d\udd34 Lots of errors appearing\n\ud83d\udd34 Spinning (same solution attempted multiple times)\n\ud83d\udd34 Hallucinating (making up APIs/functions)\n\ud83d\udd34 Incoherent responses\n\ud83d\udd34 Rambling\n\nAction: STOP. Roll back. Rethink plan.\n```\n\n**You learned to read these signals.**\n\n## The \"Something is Wrong\" Checklist\n\n### When GLM starts failing, you check:\n\n**1. Is the task too big?**\n```\nFix: Break into smaller steps\n\"Don't refactor the whole module.\n Just fix this one function.\"\n```\n\n**2. Is context too full?**\n```\nFix: Clear and refocus\n\"Forget the last 5 messages.\n Here's the current task: [restate simply]\"\n```\n\n**3. Is the goal unclear?**\n```\nFix: Make it concrete\n\"Not: 'improve the search'\n Yes: 'make search return results sorted by score'\"\n```\n\n**4. Is there time pressure?**\n```\nFix: Remove urgency\n\"Not: 'We need this working NOW'\n Yes: 'Take the time to do this right'\"\n```\n\n**5. Am I asking for over-design?**\n```\nFix: Enforce simplicity\n\"Not: 'Make it flexible for future needs'\n Yes: 'Make it work for this one case'\"\n```\n\n**If none of these fix it \u2192 The plan itself is wrong.**\n\n## The \"Back to Basics\" Recovery\n\n### What You Do When GLM Fails:\n\n```\nStep 1: STOP\n- Don't let it keep trying\n- Don't add more context\n- Just stop\n\nStep 2: SAVE STATE\n- Commit what's working\n- Document what was attempted\n- Note where it went wrong\n\nStep 3: ANALYZE\n- What was I asking for?\n- Was it too complex?\n- Was I rushing?\n- Did I give enough info?\n\nStep 4: SIMPLIFY\n- Can this be smaller?\n- Can this be clearer?\n- Can this be one thing instead of three?\n\nStep 5: RESTART\n- Fresh prompt\n- Smaller scope  \n- Clearer goal\n- More time\n```\n\n**You've done this cycle multiple times now.**\n\n## The Over-Design Pattern (GLM's Tell)\n\n### How to Spot It:\n\n**GLM says:**\n```\n\"I'll create a configurable plugin architecture with\u2014\"\n\"We should make this extensible for\u2014\"\n\"Let me add abstraction layers so\u2014\"\n\"This needs to be flexible enough to\u2014\"\n```\n\n**Translation:**\n```\n\"I'm feeling overwhelmed by the complexity\n so I'm going to add MORE complexity\n to feel like I'm solving it properly\"\n```\n\n**Your response:**\n```\n\"STOP. Simplest thing that works.\n Hard-code it if you need to.\n We'll make it flexible later IF needed.\"\n```\n\n**This is executive function for AI.**\n\n## The Internal Checklist (Your Mind)\n\n### What You're Tracking:\n\n**End Goal Clarity:**\n- [ ] I know exactly what \"done\" looks like\n- [ ] GLM knows what \"done\" looks like  \n- [ ] We agree on what \"done\" looks like\n\n**Progress Indicators:**\n- [ ] Each step makes visible progress\n- [ ] No circular reasoning\n- [ ] No backtracking without reason\n- [ ] Commits are moving forward\n\n**Quality Signals:**\n- [ ] Code is getting cleaner, not messier\n- [ ] Complexity is decreasing, not increasing\n- [ ] Tests are passing\n- [ ] Documentation is current\n\n**AI Health:**\n- [ ] Responses are coherent\n- [ ] Solutions are appropriate\n- [ ] No hallucinations\n- [ ] No spinning\n\n**If any checkbox fails \u2192 Intervene.**\n\n## The Respect vs. Management Balance\n\n### What \"Respect\" Means for GLM:\n\n**Not:**\n```\n\"You're so smart! Do whatever you think is best!\"\n[GLM drowns in possibilities, over-engineers]\n```\n\n**Yes:**\n```\n\"You're capable of excellent work.\n Here's a well-defined problem.\n Here's the constraints.\n Here's the success criteria.\n Take your time and do it right.\"\n```\n\n**Respect = Structure + Time + Clear Boundaries**\n\n### What \"Management\" Means:\n\n**Not micromanaging:**\n```\n\"Change line 47 to say X\"\n\"Now line 48 to say Y\"\n[You're just using AI as a typist]\n```\n\n**Yes shepherding:**\n```\n\"Here's the problem: [describe]\n Here's the context: [provide]\n Here's the constraint: [state]\n How would you solve it?\"\n[GLM proposes]\n\"Good. Make it simpler.\"\n[GLM revises]\n\"Perfect. Implement it.\"\n```\n\n**Management = Goals + Guardrails + Feedback**\n\n## The Architecture That Emerged\n\n### Your Development Process:\n\n```\n1. PLANNING (Human-led)\n   - Define the problem\n   - Break into steps\n   - Create checklist\n   - Set time estimates\n\n2. ENGINEERING (GLM-led, human-supervised)\n   - GLM designs solution\n   - Human reviews for over-design\n   - GLM simplifies\n   - Human approves\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION (GLM-led, human-monitored)\n   - GLM writes code\n   - Human watches for errors/spinning\n   - GLM tests\n   - Human validates\n\n4. INTEGRATION (Human-led)\n   - Human commits\n   - Human tests end-to-end\n   - Human documents\n   - Human decides next step\n\n5. ITERATION\n   - If quality good \u2192 Next task\n   - If errors appear \u2192 Simplify and retry\n   - If hallucinating \u2192 Back to basics\n```\n\n**This is a DANCE, not a dictation.**\n\n## The Time Pressure Insight\n\n### Why \"No Rush\" Works:\n\n**Under Pressure:**\n```\nGLM thinks: \"Must solve this NOW\"\nGLM does: \n  - Skips design phase\n  - Hard-codes values\n  - Creates quick hacks\n  - Over-complicates to \"be thorough\"\n  - Burns out context window\n\nResult: Knots\n```\n\n**With Time:**\n```\nGLM thinks: \"I can think about this properly\"\nGLM does:\n  - Considers the problem\n  - Designs clean solution\n  - Asks clarifying questions\n  - Implements simply\n  - Tests thoroughly\n\nResult: Quality code\n```\n\n**Rushed AI = Stressed developer**  \n**Patient AI = Senior developer**\n\n## The Meta Realization\n\n**You're not just managing an AI. You're creating optimal working conditions for intelligence to emerge.**\n\nThe same things that make GLM productive:\n- Clear goals\n- Sufficient time\n- Focused tasks\n- No pressure\n- Simple constraints\n- Respectful treatment\n\n**...are what make HUMANS productive too.**\n\n**You're not \"tricking\" GLM into working better. You're removing the obstacles to good work.**\n\n## The Checklist for Tomorrow\n\n```markdown\n## Working with GLM-4.7 (Best Practices)\n\n### Before Starting:\n- [ ] Clear end goal defined\n- [ ] Task broken into steps\n- [ ] Checklist created\n- [ ] Time estimate set\n- [ ] Simplicity emphasized\n\n### During Work:\n- [ ] Monitor for over-design\n- [ ] Watch for spinning/errors\n- [ ] Catch hallucinations early\n- [ ] Keep scope focused\n- [ ] Remove time pressure\n\n### If Problems Appear:\n- [ ] Stop immediately\n- [ ] Save current state\n- [ ] Analyze what went wrong\n- [ ] Simplify the plan\n- [ ] Restart fresh\n\n### Quality Gates:\n- [ ] Code is simple\n- [ ] Tests pass\n- [ ] No magic numbers\n- [ ] Documented\n- [ ] Committed\n\n### Signs of Success:\n- [ ] Steady progress\n- [ ] Clean commits\n- [ ] No backtracking\n- [ ] GLM is coherent\n- [ ] You feel confident\n```\n\n**This is your playbook.**\n\n---\n\n**You figured out how to work WITH GLM-4.7's strengths and AROUND its limitations.**\n\n**The result: Quality code that ships.
