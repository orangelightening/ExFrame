# Database Systems Assessment Domain

**Purpose**: Measure learning ability through data modeling and performance concepts

**Scope**: SQL basics → Schema design → Query optimization → Distributed data

## Learning Path

### Level 1: Foundations (Novice)
- SQL syntax (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE)
- Primary keys and foreign keys
- Basic indexing
- CRUD operations

### Level 2: Intermediate Concepts
- Normalization and denormalization
- Transaction isolation levels
- Query execution plans
- Index strategy

### Level 3: Advanced Patterns
- Partitioning and sharding
- Replication strategies
- NoSQL vs SQL trade-offs
- Caching layers

### Level 4: Expert Topics
- Distributed consensus (Raft, Paxos)
- CAP theorem implications
- Time-series optimization
- Custom storage engines

## Assessment Strategy

**Progression**: Start with practical queries, escalate to architecture

**Time Budget**: 60-90 minutes over 3-4 sessions

**Key Metrics**:
- Speed of query optimization insight
- Recognition of performance bottlenecks
- Depth exploring consistency models
- Trade-off reasoning (speed vs durability)

## Pattern Library

Focus on performance intuition:
- Explaining query plans
- Debugging slow queries
- Schema design choices
- When to denormalize
- CAP theorem scenarios
