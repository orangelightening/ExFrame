# API Design Assessment Domain

**Purpose**: Measure learning through interface design and integration patterns

**Scope**: REST basics → Design principles → Authentication → Distributed APIs

## Learning Path

### Level 1: Foundations (Novice)
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Status codes
- JSON structure
- Basic authentication

### Level 2: Intermediate Concepts
- RESTful design principles
- Versioning strategies
- Rate limiting
- Error handling patterns

### Level 3: Advanced Patterns
- GraphQL vs REST trade-offs
- API gateway patterns
- OAuth2 and JWT
- Webhook design

### Level 4: Expert Topics
- gRPC and Protocol Buffers
- API composition and BFF pattern
- Distributed tracing
- API governance at scale

## Assessment Strategy

**Progression**: Design exercises that reveal thinking process

**Time Budget**: 45-60 minutes over 2-3 sessions

**Key Metrics**:
- Speed of API design maturity
- Recognition of client needs
- Depth exploring consistency/caching
- Evolution from resource-centric to system-centric thinking

## Pattern Library

Focus on design judgment:
- "Design an API for..." scenarios
- Evolution and versioning challenges
- Performance vs flexibility
- Error handling philosophy
