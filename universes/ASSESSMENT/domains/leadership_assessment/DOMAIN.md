**Purpose**: Measure ability to learn management and leadership concepts

**Scope**: Team dynamics → Project management → Strategic thinking → Organizational design

## Learning Path

### Level 1: Foundations (Novice)

- Roadmap planning
- Cross-team coordination

### Level 3: Advanced Patterns

### Level 4: Expert Topics

## Assessment Strategy

**Progression**: Case studies and situational judgment

**Time Budget**: 45-60 minutes over 2-3 sessions

**Key Metrics**:
- Speed of adopting management frameworks
- Depth of follow-up questions
- Recognition of people vs process issues
- Evolution from tactical to strategic thinking

## Pattern Library

Focus on judgment and adaptability:
- Realistic scenarios with no perfect answer
- "What would you do if..." questions
- Prioritization under constraints
- Team dynamics challenges

## Interest Ratio Component

This is often the **boring domain** for technical candidates. High performers will:
- Still engage deeply despite low interest
- Ask sophisticated questions
- Maintain learning velocity
- Recognize leadership's importance

Low interest + low performance = discipline problem
