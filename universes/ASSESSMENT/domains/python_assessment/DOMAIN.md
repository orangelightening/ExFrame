# Python Assessment Domain

**Purpose**: Measure learning velocity through progressive Python complexity

**Scope**: Core Python concepts → Advanced patterns → Performance optimization

## Learning Path

### Level 1: Foundations (Novice)
- Data types and structures
- Basic control flow
- Function definition
- Error handling basics

### Level 2: Intermediate Concepts
- Object-oriented programming
- Decorators and context managers
- List comprehensions and generators
- File I/O and serialization

### Level 3: Advanced Patterns
- Metaclasses and descriptors
- Async/await and concurrency
- Memory management and optimization
- Testing strategies

### Level 4: Expert Topics
- CPython internals
- GIL and threading implications
- C extensions and performance
- Design patterns at scale

## Assessment Strategy

**Progression**: Start with L1 questions. If candidate demonstrates mastery quickly, escalate to L2/L3 within same session.

**Time Budget**: 60-90 minutes over 3-4 sessions across 10 days

**Key Metrics**:
- Time to first correct L2 answer
- Question sophistication trajectory
- Chain depth on complex topics
- Retention when revisiting concepts

## Pattern Library

Focus on patterns that reveal understanding, not rote memorization:
- Explaining **why** not just **what**
- Comparing alternatives
- Debugging scenarios
- Performance trade-offs
