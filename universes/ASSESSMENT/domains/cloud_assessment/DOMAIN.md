# Cloud Infrastructure Assessment Domain

**Purpose**: Measure ability to learn distributed systems and cloud architecture

**Scope**: AWS/GCP basics → Scalability → Cost optimization → Advanced patterns

## Learning Path

### Level 1: Foundations (Novice)
- Virtual machines vs containers
- Basic networking (VPC, subnets)
- Storage types (block, object, file)
- IAM and permissions basics

### Level 2: Intermediate Concepts
- Load balancing and auto-scaling
- Database choices (RDS, DynamoDB, etc.)
- CDN and edge computing
- CI/CD pipelines

### Level 3: Advanced Patterns
- Multi-region architecture
- Service mesh and microservices
- Event-driven design
- Cost optimization strategies

### Level 4: Expert Topics
- Global traffic management
- Disaster recovery at scale
- Security compliance (SOC2, HIPAA)
- Custom infrastructure tooling

## Assessment Strategy

**Progression**: Scenario-based questions that build on each other

**Time Budget**: 60-90 minutes over 3-4 sessions

**Key Metrics**:
- Speed of grasping distributed systems concepts
- Ability to reason about trade-offs
- Chain depth when exploring architecture
- Recognition of when to scale vs optimize

## Pattern Library

Focus on systems thinking:
- "How would you..." scenarios
- Trade-off analysis
- Cost vs performance decisions
- Failure mode reasoning
