### Documentation Reorganization - COMPLETE ✅

**Files Created:**
- `development-plan.md` (4.1K) ✅ AT ROOT
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (663 lines, 16K) ✅ AT ROOT
- `DOCUMENT_INDEX_MAINTENANCE.md` ✅ AT ROOT
- `regenerate_embeddings.py` ✅ AT ROOT

**Files Archived (18 total):**

**Design Docs (2 files):**
- Moved to design/ (PLUGIN_REFACTOR_DESIGN.md, UNIVERSAL_LOGGING_DESIGN.md)

**Final State:**
- Core files: 4 (README, CHANGELOG, ARCHITECTURE, development-plan)
- Root markdown files: 20 (down from 44)
- docs/ directory: ELIMINATED
- Librarian access: 56 documents accessible
- All technical details verified accurate

### Reference Links
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** (when created) - System design
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history
- **INDEX.md** (after moving from docs/) - Documentation navigation
- **README.md** - User guide

### Archive Principle
**No deletion.** All files to be archived will be:
1. Annotated with a note at the top explaining why archived
2. Moved to `.archive/2026-02-10-doc-reorg/`
3. Preserved in git history

## Maintenance Tasks

### Document Index Synchronization

**Critical:** The librarian's document embeddings must stay synchronized with all `.md` files in the project directory.

**Current state:**
- Total markdown files: 43
- Document embeddings: `universes/MINE/domains/exframe/doc_embeddings.json` (493K)
- Last regenerated: 2026-02-10 21:07

**When to regenerate embeddings:**
- After adding new `.md` files to project root
- After removing `.md` files from project root
- After major edits to documentation files
- After archive phase (file structure changes)

**How to regenerate:**
```bash
# Run the regeneration script
docker exec eeframe-app python3 /app/project/regenerate_embeddings.py
```

**Maintenance schedule:**
- Manual: Run script after significant documentation changes
- TODO: Automated via git hook or cron job

**Files tracked by document index:**
All 43 `.md` files at project root, including:
- Core: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, development-plan.md
- Technical: MULTITURN.md, statemachine-design.md, etc.
- Web search: WEB_SEARCH_*.md, GLM_*.md, ZAI_*.md
- Annotation: ANNOTATION_*.md, annotation.md
- Plans/Status: doc-fix.md, doc-stat.md, etc.
