# Universal Conversation Logging

**Every conversation. Automatically saved. Forever.**

---

## The Problem

You've had this experience:

- **"What did we discuss last week?"**
- **"I wish I had saved that conversation"**
- **"Where did I see that solution?"**
- **"I know I asked this before..."**

Current AI chat tools are **ephemeral**. One conversation, then it's gone. No history. No trace. No way to find that brilliant insight or perfect explanation from last month.

You're losing knowledge every single day.

---

## The Solution

**ExFrame provides universal conversation logging.**

Every query you ask. Every answer you receive. Every discussion you have.

**Automatically saved. Permanently archived. Always searchable.**

Just use ExFrame normally, and watch your knowledge base build itself.

---

## How It Works

```
You: "How do I fix this bug?"
AI: [Provides solution]
→ Automatically saved to domain_log.md

You: "What did I learn last week?"
→ Check the log. It's all there.

You: "I need that solution from last month"
→ Search the log. Found instantly.
```

**No configuration required. It just works.**

---

## What This Means

### For Developers

**Debugging becomes trivial:**
- Full history of every query
- See what worked and what didn't
- Never lose a solution again
- Build a personal knowledge base automatically

### For Learners

**Learning becomes continuous:**
- Track your progress over time
- Review what you learned last month
- Build on previous discussions
- See how far you've come

### For Researchers

**Knowledge becomes cumulative:**
- Every conversation is recorded
- Previous insights inform new discoveries
- Build on your research history
- Never repeat the same work twice

### For Writers

**Ideas never get lost:**
- Every story discussion is saved
- Character development is tracked
- Plot ideas are preserved
- Nothing falls through the cracks

## Optional: Conversation Memory

Want your AI to **remember everything**?

Enable Conversation Memory and your AI will:
- Load previous discussions into context
- Build on every conversation
- Maintain continuity across sessions
- Adapt explanations based on your history

**Two modes:**
1. **Remember everything** - Perfect for learning, research, projects
2. **On-demand memory** - Perfect for stories, chapters, serialized content

---

## Real Examples

### Learning to Program

```
Week 1: "Teach me Rust basics"
Week 2: "I'm stuck on borrowing" → AI sees you've asked 3 times, adapts
Week 5: "Quiz me on ownership" → AI reviews 5 weeks of progress
Week 10: "Ready for lifetimes" → AI builds on 10 weeks of context
```

**Everything saved. Everything remembered.**

### Writing a Novel

```
Chapter 1: "Write about space explorers" → Saved
Chapter 2: "Continue the story" → AI remembers characters, plot
Chapter 3: "Add a twist" → Maintains perfect continuity
```

**Every chapter. Automatically archived.**

### Daily Questions

```
Monday: "How do I format dates in Python?"
Tuesday: "What's a REST API?"
Wednesday: "How do I authenticate users?"
```

**Every answer. Searchable forever.**
