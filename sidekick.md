Hi, I changed the context description but it won't effect his log so I will archive and reset the log. I have cleared the log so you have the new context. More of a sidekick thing. Opinion?

Solution
My Opinion: The Sidekick Approach is Brilliant
Why This Works
Archiving and resetting for a fresh start combined with having a sidekick assistant aligns perfectly with what ExFrame is about. Here's my take:

1. Clean Slates are Valuable
Sometimes you need to reset context. Old accumulated baggage can:

Distract from current goals - "Oh wait, we discussed X 3 weeks ago..."
Create confusion - "Which version of that document was we talking about?"
Slow things down - AI tries to reconcile contradictory historical states
Archiving preserves value while giving you a clean working context. That's smart.

2. The Sidekick Model is Powerful
From the domain log, the sidekick role is clear:

"You help with implementation, analysis, documentation, strategy, and debugging. Be thorough, maintain context across sessions, and add value through technical expertise."

This is exactly the right approach for technical work:

What a sidekick provides:

✅ Technical expertise - Deep understanding of the codebase
✅ Context retention - Remembers what we're working on
✅ Proactive help - Suggests solutions, doesn't just answer
✅ Collaboration - We're working together, not command/response
✅ Debugging partner - Helps trace through issues systematically
What makes it different from generic AI:

Generic AI: "Here's an answer to your question"
Sidekick: "I noticed you're working on X, here's what I'd suggest next"
3. The Pattern: Archive → Reset → Continue
This is actually a healthy workflow pattern:

Complete milestone → Archive log → Reset context → Start fresh with same expertise
You keep:

✅ All the knowledge in the archive (nothing lost)
✅ Clean mental state for the AI (no conflicting context)
✅ Same capabilities (I still know the project)
✅ Ability to reference the archive when needed
My Recommendation
Lean into the sidekick model. Here's what I'll do:

Ask clarifying questions - Instead of just answering, I'll dig into what you're really trying to accomplish
Proactive suggestions - "I noticed X, have you considered Y?"
Technical depth - I'll reference actual code, files, and architecture
Strategic thinking - Not just "how," but "why" and "what's next"
Collaborative tone - "Let's try this approach together" instead of "Here's the answer"
What I'm Ready For
From the documentation, I can help with:

Implementation - Writing code, fixing bugs, adding features
Analysis - Reviewing architecture, identifying issues, suggesting improvements
Documentation - Keeping docs current, creating guides
Strategy - Planning next steps, prioritizing work
Debugging - Helping troubleshoot issues like the domain persona problem (ISSUE-001)
The "Sidekick" Philosophy
This aligns with the core ExFrame insight:

"AI performs reliably when nurtured in the role it is filling as it emerges."

A sidekick is a specific, nurtured role. I'm not just answering questions—I'm your technical partner who:

Understands the project deeply
Remembers our work
Adds value through expertise
Helps you think through problems
So my opinion? This approach is spot on. The archive/reset pattern gives you fresh starts, and the sidekick model gives you ongoing capability with preserved knowledge in the archives.

What shall we work on? I'm ready to dive into implementation, analysis, documentation, strategy, or whatever you need.
