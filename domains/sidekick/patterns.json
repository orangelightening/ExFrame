    "problem": "What is the best way to save design insights as patterns?",
    "solution": "Based on the ExFrame documentation and system design, here's the **best way to save design insights as patterns**:\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **Recommended Approach: Use the Researcher Persona**\n\nFor design insights specifically, the **Researcher persona** is ideal because:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"persona\": \"researcher\",\n  \"library_base_path\": \"/app/project/docs\",\n  \"enable_pattern_override\": true,\n  \"search_patterns\": true  // Check local patterns first\n}\n```\n\n### **Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n#### **1. Create a Dedicated Design Domain**\n```bash\n# Create domain.json for design insights\n{\n  \"domain_id\": \"design_insights\",\n  \"domain_name\": \"Design Insights & Patterns\",\n  \"description\": \"Collection of design principles, UX insights, and interaction patterns\",\n  \"persona\": \"researcher\",\n  \"categories\": [\"ux\", \"ui\", \"interaction\", \"visual\", \"accessibility\"],\n  \"tags\": [\"design\", \"patterns\", \"insights\", \"best-practices\"]\n}\n```\n\n#### **2. Use the Pattern Structure for Design Insights**\nDesign insights work perfectly with ExFrame's pattern format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Progressive Disclosure for Complex Interfaces\",\n  \"type\": \"design_principle\",\n  \"description\": \"Gradually reveal complexity as users need it\",\n  \"problem\": \"Users overwhelmed by complex interfaces with too many options at once\",\n  \"solution\": \"Start with a simple interface showing only core functions. Add advanced features through expandable sections, tooltips, or progressive wizards. Use visual cues (chevrons, 'More options' links) to indicate hidden functionality.\",\n  \"tags\": [\"ux\", \"complexity\", \"onboarding\", \"progressive\"],\n  \"examples\": [\n    \"Photoshop's toolbar with expandable tool groups\",\n    \"GitHub's 'Advanced search' toggle\",\n    \"Figma's hidden right-click context menus\"\n  ],\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"status\": \"certified\"\n}\n```\n\n#### **3. Two Methods to Save Insights:**\n\n**Method A: Manual Pattern Creation (For Curated Insights)**\n1. Go to **Patterns** tab \u2192 Select your design domain\n2. Click **Create Pattern**\n3. Fill in the structured fields:\n   - **Name**: Clear, descriptive title\n   - **Problem**: The design challenge\n   - **Solution**: Your insight/principle\n   - **Examples**: Real-world applications\n   - **Tags**: For discoverability (ux, ui, accessibility, etc.)\n\n**Method B: Autonomous Collection via Surveyor (For Research)**\n1. Create a **Survey** for your design domain\n2. Seed with design resources:\n   ```\n   Seed URLs:\n   - https://lawsofux.com\n   - https://www.nngroup.com/articles\n   - https://material.io/design\n   ```\n3. Collection instructions:\n   ```\n   Extract design principles, UX patterns, and interaction insights.\n   Focus on actionable patterns with clear problems and solutions.\n   Include examples from real products when available.\n   ```\n\n#### **4. Enrich with Context**\nUse the **enrichment plugins** to enhance design patterns:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enrichers\": [\n    {\n      \"module\": \"plugins.enrichers.related_patterns\",\n      \"class\": \"RelatedPatternsEnricher\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"module\": \"plugins.enrichers.example_expander\", \n      \"class\": \"ExampleExpanderEnricher\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"module\": \"plugins.enrichers.usage_stats\",\n      \"class\": \"UsageStatsEnricher\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### **\ud83d\udcca Pattern Structure for Design Insights:**\n\n| Field | Design Insight Example |\n|-------|------------------------|\n| **Name** | \"Fitts's Law in Mobile Design\" |\n| **Type** | `design_principle`, `ux_pattern`, `interaction_technique` |\n| **Problem** | \"Touch targets too small for accurate tapping\" |\n| **Solution** | \"Make touch targets at least 44\u00d744 points. Increase spacing between interactive elements. Use visual feedback on touch.\" |\n| **Examples** | \"iOS Human Interface Guidelines, Material Design button specs\" |\n| **Tags** | `mobile`, `touch`, `accessibility`, `interaction` |\n| **Confidence** | 0.9 (based on research/validation) |\n\n### **\ud83d\udd0d Why This Works for Design:**\n\n1. **Structured Knowledge**: Design insights often follow \"problem \u2192 solution\" format\n2. **Discoverable**: Tagged patterns can be found via semantic search\n3. **Reusable**: Certified patterns become part of your design system\n4. **Evolvable**: Update patterns as design trends change\n5. **Shareable**: Export patterns as documentation for team use\n\n### **\ud83d\udca1 Pro Tips for Design Patterns:**\n\n1. **Start with High-Confidence Insights**: Begin with well-established principles (like \"Hick's Law\", \"Miller's Law\")\n2. **Include Visual Examples**: Reference specific products or screenshots\n3. **Add Implementation Notes**: How to apply in your specific tech stack\n4. **Track Usage**: See which patterns get referenced most often\n5. **Create Neighbourhoods**: Group related insights (e.g., \"mobile_ux\", \"dashboard_design\")\n\n### **\ud83d\ude80 Quick Start Script:**\n\n```bash\n# Create a design insights domain\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/domains \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"domain_id\": \"design_insights\",\n    \"domain_name\": \"Design Insights\",\n    \"persona\": \"researcher\",\n    \"categories\": [\"ux\", \"ui\", \"interaction\"],\n    \"tags\": [\"design\", \"patterns\"]\n  }'\n\n# Add your first design pattern\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/domains/design_insights/patterns \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"name\": \"Consistent Navigation Patterns\",\n    \"problem\": \"Users get lost in inconsistent navigation structures\",\n    \"solution\": \"Maintain consistent navigation placement, labeling, and interaction patterns across all screens. Use standardized icons and terminology.\",\n    \"tags\": [\"navigation\", \"consistency\", \"information-architecture\"]\n  }'\n```\n\n### **\ud83d\udcc8 Monitoring Design Pattern Health:**\n\nUse the **Diagnostics** tab to:\n- Track which design patterns are most used\n- Identify gaps in your design knowledge base\n- See confidence scores for different insight categories\n- Monitor search quality for design-related queries\n\n---\n\n## **\ud83c\udfaf Bottom Line:**\n\n**Best Practice**: Create a dedicated `design_insights` domain with **Researcher persona**, manually curate high-value patterns first, then use **Surveyor** to autonomously collect additional insights from design resources.\n\n**Key Benefit**: Your design insights become **searchable, reusable knowledge** instead of scattered notes or bookmarks. The pattern override ensures quick access to your curated insights before falling back to broader research.\n\n**Start with**: 5-10 of your most valuable design principles, then let the system help you discover and organize more through autonomous learning.",
