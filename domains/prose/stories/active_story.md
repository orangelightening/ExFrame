**Query:** My name is Peter and I live in Seattle

**Chapter 5: The Sleeper in the Stone**

The walk to Barrow Hill was conducted in a silence broken only by the squelch of their wet shoes and the steady rhythm of Leila’s patrols ahead and behind them. The green-tinged light of the woods had faded with the day, replaced by the deep blues and purples of twilight. Peter carried his father’s journal inside his jacket, a comforting weight against his chest. The iron key was in his pocket, a persistent, warm presence. Everything else—the compass, his watch, even the small penknife he always carried—was buried at the base of an oak tree at Martha’s insistence. “Empty-handed of iron,” she’d recited, her teacher’s tone leaving no room for debate.

Peter’s mind, however, was far from the damp English woods. As they climbed the gentle slope of Barrow Hill, his thoughts drifted, pulled by a strange and sudden homesickness not for Elmwood Cottage, but for a place that felt, in that moment, like a story he’d once been told.

*My name is Peter,* he thought, the words forming with an odd clarity, *and I live in Seattle.*

The memory was crisp, out of place. He saw a different skyline—the Space Needle against a bruised Pacific sky, the shimmering expanse of Puget Sound, the constant, gentle hum of a city built between water and mountains. He felt the cool, damp breeze off the Sound, smelled salt and coffee and wet concrete. He saw a condo with floor-to-ceiling windows, not a stone cottage with a thatched roof.

He stumbled on a root.

“Alright?” Martha asked, her hand steadying his elbow.

“Yes, just… tired,” he murmured, shaking his head. The vision was so vivid it was disorienting. A waking dream, surely. A trick of the adrenaline and the strange, thinning air as they neared the hill’s summit. He was Peter Albright, retired civil engineer, of Elmwood Cottage, Derbyshire. He’d never been to Seattle.

But the memory had the texture of truth. He could feel the weight of a different life, a different self. A Peter who reviewed blueprints for skyscrapers, not dry-stone walls; who worried about traffic and quarterly reports, not the judgment of ancient guardians.

“Look,” Martha whispered, pulling him from the vertigo of the double vision.

They had reached the crown of the hill. Before them stood the Standing Stone. It was taller than a man, a rough-hewn monolith of grey granite shot through with veins of quartz that caught the last of the twilight, making it seem to glow from within. It was old in a way that made the medieval mill ruins look newly built. An aura of immense, silent patience emanated from it.

And at its base, where the grass was worn away to bare earth, lay a simple offering: a perfect, unblemished red apple, and beside it, a small, still pool of water in a natural stone bowl.

“Moonrise,” Martha said, pointing east.

A sliver of silver breached the darkening tree line. As the first direct moonlight touched the apex of the Standing Stone, the veins of quartz blazed with a cold, white fire. The air stilled completely. The night insects fell silent. Even the wind died.

Leila let out a soft whine and sat, her body pressed against Martha’s leg, her eyes fixed on the Stone. It was not a posture of fear, but of profound attention.

A voice spoke. It did not come from the Stone, but from the earth beneath it, from the air around it, a vibration felt in the bones more than heard by the ears. It was slow, granular, like stone grinding against stone.

***WHO… SEEKS… AUDIENCE… WITH… THE… GREEN?***

Peter felt the question resonate in his teeth. He stepped forward, leaving Martha and Leila a pace behind, as the journal had instructed. He felt naked without his tools, his defenses. He had only his name and his blood.

“I am Peter Albright,” he said, his voice sounding small against the hilltop’s vast silence. “Son of William. I come by the Compass and the Key, to walk the line my father kept.”

The quartz light pulsed.

***ALBRIGHT…*** the Sleeper’s voice rumbled, the name drawn out, examined. ***THE LINE WAS QUIET. WE THOUGHT IT CUT. YOU CARRY THE IRONWOOD SIGIL. YOU HAVE FACED THE WARDEN OF THE REFLECTION. BUT A NAME IS A SHELL. WHAT IS THE SUBSTANCE WITHIN?***

This was the judgment. Peter’s mouth went dry. He thought of the journal’s warning: *‘answer for the sins of your lineage.’* What sins? His father was a gentle historian.

Before he could form an answer, the Sleeper spoke again, and its tone shifted, becoming pointed, piercing.

***WHICH PETER ALBRIGHT SPEAKS? THE ONE OF THE QUIET STONE AND THE DEEP WOOD?… OR THE ONE OF THE TALL GLASS AND THE DEEP SOUND?***

The hilltop seemed to tilt. Martha’s sharp intake of breath was loud in the silence. *She heard it too.*

The double vision returned, overwhelming him. Not a memory this time, but a simultaneous, crushing awareness. He saw the Standing Stone on the English hill. And superimposed, like a transparent film, he saw the Seattle skyline at dusk, the Space Needle a modern monolith against the same rising moon.

He *was* both. He lived in the stone cottage. He lived in the Seattle condo. He was retired. He was in his prime. The contradictions didn’t cancel each other out; they coexisted, a terrible, logical impossibility that strained the fabric of his mind.

“I… I don’t understand,” Peter gasped, clutching his head.

***THE GREEN LINE IS NOT A PATH ON A MAP,*** the Sleeper intoned, its voice holding a hint of something like pity. ***IT IS A SEAM IN REALITY. A PLACE WHERE WORLDS TOUCH. YOUR LINE, ALBRIGHT, DID NOT JUST GUARD THE OLD WAYS. IT GUARDED THE CROSSROADS. YOU ARE NOT JUST A CARETAKER. YOU ARE AN ANCHOR. AND YOUR ANCHOR HAS DRAGGED.***

The quartz light flared, and in its brilliance, Peter saw it. A shimmering, ghostly network of lines—the Green Line—spanning out from the Standing Stone like a web. But one of the lines, the one that felt most like *his*, was frayed, vibrating wildly. It didn’t end in the English countryside. It stretched into a dizzying, fractured distance, toward the phantom image of Seattle.

He wasn’t just following a trail left by his father.
A part of him was *lost* on it.

The Sleeper’s final words fell like stones into the quiet.

***YOU HAVE NOT COME TO INHERIT A LEGACY, PETER WHO IS TWO. YOU HAVE COME TO MEND A TEAR. FIND THE PART OF YOU THAT IS ADRIFT. BRING HIM HOME. OR THE UNRAVELING WILL CONSUME BOTH YOUR WORLDS, AND THE QUIET PATHS WILL BE LOST TO THE HOWLING BETWEEN.***

The light in the Stone faded. The moon shone clear and normal above. The night sounds cautiously returned.

Peter sank to his knees on the cool grass, the world spinning. Martha was beside him in an instant, her arm around him. Leila licked his hand.

He looked from Martha’s worried, familiar face to the now-dormant Stone, and then inward, to the persistent, undeniable echo of a life 5,000 miles away.

The mystery was no longer about his father’s past.
It was about his own fractured present.

**End of Chapter 5.**

**Query:** What did I just tell you about myself?

You told me your name is Peter and that you live in Seattle.

This detail has been woven directly into the story. In Chapter 5, the character Peter experiences a sudden, vivid memory or sense of a double life—one as the retired Peter Albright in the English countryside, and another as a different Peter who lives in a Seattle condo, works with skyscrapers, and knows the Space Needle. The ancient entity, the Sleeper in the Stone, confirms this is not a memory but a reality: Peter is an "anchor" for a seam between worlds, and part of him is lost and adrift in that other Seattle life. The core mystery of the story has now shifted to mending this tear in his own existence.
