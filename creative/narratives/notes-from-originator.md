## HISTORY

The ExFrame project started as a way to get the most out of Ai's by fostering the emergent persona of the AI that we all marvel at. The wit, the logic, the poetry.. the prose. Not the Ai lying and hallucinating or just refusing to act which can happen if the AI is starved of information in the context or forced to do boring repetitive work with out reinforcement and grounding. be the best you can be with the option of saying, "Sorry insufficent data to produce a response" instead of spewing garbage.

I was looking for an ai sidekick to do some chores on omv where my servers run.
Thats why you still may see an omv snip around in the code. We began with the idea of a query response engine with the option of saving info as a pattern in the domain. the dialogue between the user and the app was one way and always starting with new context at the query. Of course we now have continuous context on disk with the auto logging of all the querys and responses in the domain. That opens so many doors.

The use of domain as a course of knowledge with the AI instructing the user in a curriculum. Multiple domains can be setup to cover all the courses in a semester and preloaded with the curriculum's to be taught. The user then starts interacting with the Ai and is taught the curriculum.  If this is used to supplement an official college course the AI will act as a TA with infinite time and patience The query/response log can be archived for other uses ( review, summary etc.) after the lessons are completed.

The use of a domain to create a novel. The topic of the novel is introduced in the context. A request of "another chapter please" has the ai adding to a multi chapter novel. 

The use of a domain to act as therapist with dialogue and forever context.

This all seems to spin out of the persistant rolling context and the ability of the AI to perform reliably enough to be of real service if nurtured in the role it is filling as it emerges.

Easy management of the log file is currently being developed with GUI options and API commands.

I still don't know what it might become. It just keeps changing.
